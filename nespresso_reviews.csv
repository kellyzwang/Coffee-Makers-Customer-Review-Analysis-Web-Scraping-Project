November 28 2018,1.0,768,it will happen to every owner eventually! read the manual!,this was an amazing anniversary gift until it broke months later!!! the machine entered into some sort of descaling mode! i have gone through the manual and descaled the machine  i have spent the money on the descaling chemical and still the machine won't work! the nespresso website is no help and now i no longer have my favorite thing about the morning!! i have spent hundreds of dollars on capsules so for this to happen after 10 months of use i am furious! terrible issue to have especially since it was working fine! but some sensor shuts it down!!
December 15 2017,5.0,304,fancy  espresso machine,this is my first nespresso vertuoline machine and i love it. i got it on sale for $113 on black friday with the milk frother.let's start with the ease of use of this espresso machine. you press the top coffee button and the machine warms up  the green light becomes steady and it's ready to brew. put in your favorite capsule and close the top lid and press the coffee button. did i mention the motorized capsule lid? the lid opens and closes itself with a touch of the lever and disposes the capsules into its bin on the back of the machine.milk frother is even easier to use. just pour the milk in and press the button. adding the froth of milk makes you feel like a real barista! you can totally make the same exact drinks as they make at starbucks for the fraction of the cost. and the drinks are super strong depending on which intensities you choose.i paired this machine with double-walled coffee/espresso cups also purchased on amazon. much better than your everyday ceramic cups so you can see what you're drinking and the art you just created in the cups. i also purchased the storage drawer holder for capsules that stores the capsules and machine on top (see pics)!this is like any other home appliance. you have to upkeep things like this. clean it. maintain it. if you don't do any of these things  things will eventually break. and for the people that gave this product 1 star  return it if it's broken?
March 6 2017,5.0,687,amazing tasting coffee but at a premium price,if you've never had coffee from a nespresso vertuo machine  you owe it to yourself to try it out. it is a whole level beyond keurig-type brewing.most coffee makers use some variation of pouring hot water over coffee grounds  from standard drip machines to the convenience of keurig machines. the first generation nespresso machine used the traditional espresso technique of pressurized water forced through the coffee grounds. while this produces superior coffee  it also is loud because of the pressurized pump required  and is also prone to mechanical failure. the new generation vertuo machines use a entirely new way of making coffee by putting the coffee pod in a miniature centrifuge and using that pressure to drive the hot water through the coffee instead of using hydraulic pressure. the result is fantastic-- a rich coffee with an amazing crema that is the equal or better to any you've ever tasted.the pros:  it gives a rich brewed crema to both espresso and regular coffee blends. it is super easy to use and quiet and actually is smaller than my keurig. it gives coffee that is the equal or better to starbucks  especially if you use a separate frother when you blend in milk or cream.the cons: expense.  the pods are only sold by nespresso  are limited in availability  and cost over a buck a piece. that's why i would really recommend to try before you buy if you can--- if you truly love great coffee or if you want to cut back on your starbucks habit but can't face just ordinary drip coffee  this nespresso could be your new best friend.
September 12 2018,4.0,163,love this delonghi espresso maker,i received this from amazon warehouse deals so i bought it at a discounted price for open box and it is amazing. the coffee is definitely delicious and coffee house quality. the only downside is the cost of the pods. however it beats  $4 a cup  at the local coffee shop. some of the flavors are just too strong for me. those two reasons are why i gave it 4 stars. my husband loves the espressos. he thinks this is the best machine ever!
August 3 2018,5.0,139,a great product  technically refined  very convenient  way ahead of the competition,while other brands of single serve coffee maker have none little to improve their technology nespresso has taken a quantum leap forward..-the machine is much quieter-one touch to warm up (fast) and brew-completely customizable cup volume from 2 through 14 oz  (a basic idea lost on caffitaly or starbucks)(btw i would not pay more for the alto 14 oz pods - the more intense regular sizes seem to stretch to 12 oz + and still give you a great cup.)-water tank you can grip in one hand  lift off  and refill easily-one touch powered mechanism to drop a pod in-used pod box you can lift out with one finger and empty- all the water ends up in your cup - none in the pod box  or anywhere else.- the coffee is pretty good too - $1.1 per cup - worth it for the convenience imhono tea capsules yet - hopefully soon
September 2 2018,2.0,114,flimsy plastic. not made to last. very disappointed.,i had a nespresso machine for 18 years. it finally guit. we didn’t need a fancy one so we chose this one. it is so cheaply made!  i can see why my original one lasted so long. the water container is really cheap plastic bi don’t expect this machine to last 3 years let alone 18 years. it’s easy to use i like the new way of expelling the capsules. i am afraid that if i dropped any part it would break. i don’t care if i can get replacements. i saw this model when i was in germany. it was not so cheaply made. not satisfied
December 10 2017,4.0,111,i purchased the nespresso vertuoplus and love it. my only complaint is the milk frothier ...,i purchased the nespresso vertuoplus and love it. my only complaint is the milk frothier is missing one of the whisks. since i’ve been using the machine and don’t want to deal with the hassle of returning it i’ll have to reach out to the seller to see if they will ship a whisk to me.i first tried nespresso at my friends and liked it but wanted a larger quantity than an espresso. i didn’t know that there are machines that brew larger quantities  8oz and 14oz.yeah it’s not as cheap as brewing a cup of coffee but i wasn’t doing that either. instead i was buying a cup every day at work for $2. so for me it’s cheaper.i have to say the coffee is much better tasting than keriug  not sure if i spelled that correctly  and starbucks.the machine is very easy to use. push up on the lever to open  the motorized lid opens  drops the spent pod at the same time  install the new pod  press down on the lever to close  and push the button at top to start.the milk frothier is extremely easy to use. pour in the milk to one of the two fill lines  close and press the button. since i only have the one whisk i’ve only filled it to the lower level and frothed hot milk for hot drinks. i haven’t used it yet  but if you press and hold the button for 2 seconds you can froth milk for cold drinks. hot the button flashes red and cold it flashes blue. pretty smart.if you are considering this machine  what are you waiting for?update 12/17/17:  the instructions are not the most detailed  but i did notice that the provided whisk can be converted by removing the spring. in the lid there is a spring storage bracket when you are using the whisk without the spring. therefore  the package came complete and i’ve upgraded my rating to 5 stars. the only reason i gave 4 stars is because i thought it was short one whisk.
June 16 2020,1.0,35,another leaky customer,my husband bought the nespresso vertuo plus for me for my birthday in december 2019. by june 2020 it's leaking with every use. he saw that a few of the older models sold on amazon had less than 4 star rating based on some durability issues  so he went with this version  which had a 4.5 star rating.i used it a few times a week  mostly on the weekends  until i started working from home in march due to covid-19. i loved the coffee and variety of pods available  but i am hugely disappointed in the quality of the machine.  given the volume of threads i found researching this issue - this is a systemic quality issue that has no "home" solution. after speaking with the customer service representative this morning  the only option is to send it in for repairs or replacement. it's fine for now  it's still under warranty  but i have no confidence that it will be usable long-term.
April 13 2019,4.0,42,fast and convenient coffee/espresso machine,the nespresso vertuoplus coffee and espresso maker by de'longhi is my 2nd nespresso machine.  i purchased it almost six months ago and it has worked well for me.the unit is much quieter than the nespresso pixie espresso maker i have and it heats up more quickly.  for early morning use the pixie is loud enough to wake up a light sleeper.  that is not a worry with the new machine.i like the option to make full size cups of coffee and the selection of pods that came with the machine was varied enough to help me find the flavors i enjoy best. i will keep using the pixie for espresso until the veturoline espresso sized pods find a lower price-per-cup.i do think the price per veturoline pod is high but that does not detract from the machine.i have read some reviews about a problem with scaling.  i only use distilled water in all of my coffee machines and although i have only had this machine for just over 5 months  i have used my 1st nespresso machine almost daily for over 2 years and i have not experienced any scaling issues with it.the nespresso vertuoplus coffee and espresso maker by de'longhi is a good machine and with a fair price.  it is easy to use and easy to clean and has a larger water reservoir than expected. if you are interested in trying the veturoline pods i recommend this machine.
September 13 2019,1.0,33,broke twice in first 6 months - would not buy again,bought full price in march  broke by july. the machine started leaking coffee out of the bottom. it is not even in daily use and was broke within weeks. after contacting nespresso for repair  it took a full week to get the padded repair box from to send it in for warranty covered repair and then another two weeks for it to come back  only to have the same problem happen again several weeks later. once again i am having to mail in this clearly defective product  rather then getting a replacement. i’m only getting it repaired at this point to use up the pods we have left and then will likely find another more reliable product.
April 29 2019,1.0,30,amazing coffee if it comes out,april 28  2019review of nespresso vertuoplus coffee and espresso maker by de'longhi with aeroccino  greyprosthe coffee tastes better than starbucks or anywhere that makes it.  it creates a frothy foam on the top of the coffee and really makes it an excellent cup.  this is about 10x better than kureg as far as taste.  initial setup was easy out of the box.  first cups were perfect and the machine made them without issue.consafter about 2 months we have run into a few problems.  the machine does not consistently work and continues to throw out the error code of "no water" or "water container empty" even when there is water in it.  see the video for proof.  after about 10-15 attempt it works and makes a cup.  luckily it doesn't reject the pod and it can be reused (even though it doesn't really even use it).  note this doesn't happen every time and usually it is the 2nd cup of the day that we end up fighting with the machine on.  the other major complaint i have about this machine is precisely the way it tells you the error code.  there is no display which code show a code.  in stead you have to watch the flashing light and count how many red or green lights flash and how long they stay eliminated.  then you have to use the manual to look up the red/green code.  why can't you just have a $2 display that shows the status of the machine...wow!  what century are we in...lets make the error code reading as complicated at we can that way the user has to guess at the actual problem.  come on nespresso!  even a $5 calculator has a digital display.  ok  back to the issue.  as you can see on the video there is water in the carafe yet the machine continue to through an error.  we are getting more and more frustrated by the cup.  i will leave the rating at 3 stars but only because the coffee is so damn good.... when it does create a cup full.update 5/11/2019ok.  now we are going down to 1-star (from 3).  the machine makes the first cup every morning just fine.  the 2nd cup never works.  the "refill water" light flashing comes on after you press the button to start the 2nd cup.  i called customer service at amazon and because we are over the 30-day window (actually 35) amazon won't take it back.  they patch me into nespresso hot-line and then nespresso wants to troubleshoot the problem  all over again.  after talking to two people at nespresso and arguing over what the red flashing light means and actually reading the manual to the nespresso person on the phone she finally agrees to "repair" the machine.  at first she wanted to only send an empty ups box so the machine could be sent to be "repaired by a technician".  she told me that process would take about 2-weeks.  i told her that was unacceptable and i needed coffee.  she reluctantly agreed to send a "loaner" machine that we could use while our machine is "being repaired".  after an hour with her on the phone i was ready to give up.  it was apparent she had a "protocol" that she had to follow in order to reduce the returns and get customers to give-up because their customer service process is too complicated or there is too much push-back from the representative.  i'm overall very disappointed with nespresso and wish i would have purchased the machine at the local target.  at-least then i could just take it back or buy another one and then take this one back.  nespresso you need to whole-heartedly stand behind your product for greater than 35 days and not give your customers the run-around.  think about how many people i'm going to tell about my experience with your product and the poor customer service.  also  add a digital display to the machine  it can't cost more than a free calculator display.  a real code to read instead of a flashing light to count flashes like morse code would really help your customers and your customer service representatives in troubleshooting the errors...duhh!
November 22 2018,5.0,39,need to revise my earlier review about leaking tank.,i was really looking forward to getting this. heard makes excellent coffee. however  the tank leaks horrible. my counter was soaked. i should have taken those reviews about leaking tank more seriously.i am revising my earlier review. the tank leak was my error for overfilling it to clean it.  when making coffee with normal amount of water  no leaks. and it does make a wonderful cup of coffee.
April 28 2019,5.0,18,5 months later and it's a dream,i waited to write this review after seeing some comments in other reviews that the machine enters a descaling mode and breaks about three months in.  well  i've had my machine since christmas (gift to myself) and i've had no such problem.  i've been enjoying my coffee ritual so much now that i also bought a milk frother  but not the nespresso branded one as that seems too expensive.  i love that i can make any coffee drink i desire. i love the different size pods  and how you can program each pod size to brew a certain volume of coffee.  my favorite pods are the alto pods  which is new with this machine.  and i love that i can feel good about having "pod coffee" again with their pod recycling program.now  about descaling.  last week  i descaled my machine for the first time and had no problems and the coffee is back to tasting like new.  i thought the machine would warn me when it needed to be descaled  but 5 months in i never got the warning and figured i better be proactive.  i've been using filtered water in the machine  so maybe that held off some of the buildup. i find coffee tastes better with filtered water anyway.but  the machine was getting noisier  and the coffee was starting to sputter when coming out of the spout  so i thought it might be time to descale.  so i used one of their descaling packs and followed the directions in my manual.  the machine did its thing and now i'm back to like new operation with less noise again and more flavor for about a week.  i wonder if perhaps the problems people had are because the machine's setting lets the buildup get too bad before prompting you to descale.last tip is nespresso has a wide range of coffee profiles  so i suggest trying sample packs (and always ordering your free 2-pack when ordering pods on the nespresso site) to find the right flavor profile for you.  i love this machine and love having my morning coffee now!
April 14 2019,1.0,24,water leaks,do not buy!!!! this machine is 3 days old. i have water leaking all over my kitchen counter. first time plugging it in  i was impressed by being able to brew a full cup of coffee and i also have a (pixie). my excitement washed away quickly because the machine started leaking everywhere. i thought that was odd. i cleaned up the mess but the machine continues to leak every time i use it. i will be calling amazon and nespresso today. this review will be updated after i find out if my machine will be replaced or fixed.
November 27 2018,1.0,26,leaks!,i should have listened to the other reviews - this water tank leaks!!  just as other reviewers said it would.
July 7 2020,1.0,8,started leaking after 1.2 years.  they want $125 to fix.,you have to ask yourself... do you feel lucky? it seems that the seals on some of these that fit the top of the coffee pod randomly go hard and crack letting the coffee escape as the pod is spun.  you'll know if you're one of the unlucky few if you start getting coffee down the back of the machine and all over your counter. if you're really unlucky like me  it will be just out of warranty and they'll want $125 to fix it or they'll give you a discount on a new one after accusing you of being the problem because you didn't clean the machine once a week.  who does that?.  in any case  neither is really an acceptable solution to what is definitely a design flaw.  my old tossimo worked for 11 years and i only switched to this machine because i couldn't find the pods for that one anywhere anymore.  so  my recommendation is to run in the other direction.  buy a different model  buy a keurig  buy a drip coffee maker... or if you're feeling lucky  roll the dice.  i wish you luck!update:  i liked the coffee enough that we rolled the dice and bought a new virtuoline next machine.  this machine is engineered much better.  they basically gave-up on trying to stop the system from leaking and just engineered the new machine to manage the leaks.  now  any leaking flows into a little cup under the spent pod storage.  so  even if the machine leaks  at least it won't get all over your counter like the virtuoplus machines do.  basically  in my mind  this is an admission that the virtuoplus machines have a major leak issue  and their refusal to acknowledge this or address it a few months past the warranty is poor business.  run away from this particular model.  buy a virtuonext.  you'll lose the motorized lid  but you won't miss it  and you'll save yourself a ton of mess and money when the machine inevitably starts leaking.
November 27 2018,5.0,16,love this bundle! incredible value!,so glad i persisted to try to find this holiday bundle. it’s a great machine and for the price  an incredible value! it makes a hot frothy cup of coffee and a rich espresso. the only thing that i dislike about nespresso in general in the lack of pod availability. they have to be ordered. making sure you always have coffee and espresso does require a little planning due to having to order. the frother that comes with this machine works great! i love being able to make myself a latte!
January 3 2018,1.0,39,save yourself from utter disappointment & hassle.,well  let's just say this was an epic failure of a holiday gift for the hubby.  it turned on  we started running the suggested cleaning cycle and then it stopped working.  and by stop working  i mean it left the lid open  water inside the machine  and never did anything else.  i contacted nespresso's customer service and was advised to send it back to amazon as it was a "defective machine."  i have no confidence in this brand of coffee maker...you would think that for over a hundred and fifty dollars for a coffee maker  it would make coffee. not in this case.  on the up side  amazon refunded my money and took the big hunk of junk back.  save for yourself hassle and frustration--do not buy ;)
January 16 2019,1.0,24,amazon is selling defective units,my vertuo plus didn’t work the first day i tried to use it. i called the nespresso helpdesk and they told me that amazon had a defective batch that they refused to return. don’t buy this junk.
March 6 2019,3.0,10,great coffee butttttttttt expensive vertuoline brings it down!,good luck getting vertuoline coffee anywhere else except amazon. your local big box stores don't carry it. what's vertuoline coffee you ask? well  it's these newer giant pods from nespresso. when i bought this machine  i should have better educated myself  because these things are both rare and expensive comparably to k-cups etc.the good is that the coffee it does produce is excellent. tastes good  high caffeine (if that's what you're into) and just works. it expels the pod neatly into it's little trash bin behind it  which is good for an office setting like ours. it also heats up relatively quickly compared to kcup machines we've had in the past. it also uses aluminum pods  which for those bpa-phobic out there  i'm sure is a very good thing and perhaps worth the premium. machine also looks good  is easy to clean  and works perhaps too simply  literally it's so simple that people get confused operating it.the bad is expensive pods that are hard to find. also we still haven't figured out how to get it to dispense just hot water for tea  hot cocoa  etc. when we do  it goes into "cleaning" mode and dispenses pretty much all the hot water.anyways  we got the machine on sale  it makes good tasting coffee so it's worth it for some. i wouldn't buy it again or necessarily recommend it for the simple reason you're locked into their rare vertuo line crapola. if this somehow becomes as mainstream as kcups  then cool  but i've seen no sign of that and quite honestly the opposite.  for the price of the vertuo line pods  you're pretty close to a cup at mcdonalds/sbux to begin with  so it's hard to justify the expense.
June 5 2021,1.0,7,don’t buy nespresso vertu machines!!,this machine works perfectly for a few months or even longer  then all sort of problems start happening. this is not my first experience with nespresso machines  i have been a very loyal customer since 2015  with more than 200 sleeves per year! … i replaced over 5 machines since then! yes 5 machines! this is not what to expect from a reputable company. honestly  their machines are not reliable at all  even if you do all their maintenance recommendations with descaling and clean cycles and everything… i love their coffee  it’s the best  but because of their crappy machines  i will stop buying their coffee. a lot of people on youtube are complaining about their machines too  leakage  blockage  stopped working  you name it. bottom line: unless they start doing factory recalls on their defective machines  or work on better machines  don’t buy their coffee/products.
April 4 2018,3.0,27,good coffee  but not reliable machine.,quit working after a little over a month. nespresso fixed it and provided a loaner while they did.  i feel they should have replaced the unit because now  it doesn't brew coffee as hot as it did when it was new.
February 16 2021,1.0,5,stuck in descaling mode,this machine worked wonderfully right up until it got stuck in descaling mode now it’s more worthless than a bleeding paperweight.  the nespresso web site people just tell you to follow the instructions in the manual that didn’t work before i contacted them.  i have never been more disappointed in a purchase in my life... be warned this thing is a expensive chunk of junk.2days later.... i finally got on to a different customer service rep who actually knew how to get my coffee pot out of the descale mode took about 1 1/2 hours and one hell of a long phone call but it's back up and running.  will sell it soon and get something that's not so complex all i want is good coffee
March 10 2019,5.0,15,worth it,i originally got the vertuo evoluo because i was a recreational coffee/espresso drinker and didn't think i needed the aeroccino bundle. ended up returning it within a week because although the coffee was good  it just wasn't brewing hot enough. this machine is exactly what i was looking for - brews hot enough!!!  beautiful design  takes up less counter space  and comes with the milk frother. worth the $$ in my opinion. will update if i find that it leaks.
June 17 2020,1.0,5,beware! this broke one month after warranty expired,the machine made great coffee until it didn't. exactly one month after the warranty expired  the machine started leaking copious amounts of brewed coffee from the bottom of the machine. i did a google search that yielded hundreds of similar complaints. taking the advice of one troubleshooter  i called the manufacturer. after being disconnected during the first call  i found an agent who tried to talk me through a fix over the phone  reading cheat notes from a company-issued binder  which meant that there was not much thinking outside-of-the-box going on. after 30 minutes of manipulating a toothpick  a toothbrush and warm sudsy water  we got nowhere. the final solution? either send the $134.25 machine to get fixed for a fee of $125 or purchase a replacement machine at "25% discount"--which  by the way  was the exact same price listed on amazon.  neither were solutions that i found to be acceptable. i can only thank my stars that i have my old keurig still in the garage.
January 3 2018,5.0,12,this machine broke my $4 a day coffee shop habit,just a week prior to this purchase i bought the original espresso only nespresso not realizing there was a version that brewed coffee. i quickly returned that purchase and bought the vertuoline.there are two versions / manufacturers of the nespresso vertuoline--- 1) delonghi (this one) and 2) breville. i chose the delonghi version exclusively for the swivel water tank feature. aside from this functional difference they appear to be identical aside from design appearance.  i'm really glad i went with this one as it really comes in handy having the tank on same side as sink.  i've even moved the machine to opposite side and swiveled the tank to accommodate it.its important to note that this machine uses vertuoline size round pods only. you cannot view the small espresso capsules. there is a line of espresso capsules that fit this machine however the selection is more limited than the original nespresso line (it is however growing).before purchasing i read many reviews which mention a problem with the water temp being too cool. this comes down to preference- i would say this pumps out sufficiently hot coffee for my liking.  i noticed the second consecutive cup brews a bit warmer than the first cup (maybe the machine warms up).  nespresso told us that you can prime the machine by brewing a cup of plain water first-- this hasn't been necessary -- my hubby prefers his coffee extra hot so i always brew my cup first and his second.  he's had no complaints and doesn't need to microwave it for additional heat.the frother is also great- try using low fat or no fat milk for the best front. i tried half and half and it doesn't foam near as well.  i wish the container had a lip to pour from but that's my only feedback.i seen a nespresso demo years ago at target and i wish i had taken the leap sooner. in the bay area i had a daily philz coffee 4$ day habit and i haven't been once since this purchase.  my favorite capsule is the giornio. add a splash of heavy whipping cream for perfection.  brews with a beautiful foam on top. perfection!
May 6 2020,2.0,7,amazing – until it’s not,we loved this machine when we first got it – it took a while to find the right flavors that weren’t bitter but we did and it was great.... but in less than 1 year the machine started to leak coffee out of the back when we used it  and eventually broke down. customer support was zero help  and barely answer the phone with impossible wait times. i am heartbroken that we spent so much money on a machine that doesn’t last.
July 19 2021,1.0,5,just quit working: am so disappointed ☹️!,i got two different coffees which were delicious 😋. then this used machine decided to quit on its own! i tried reloading three new pods. and following all instructions also emailed to me by the seller. no luck whatsoever  the machine just refused to come on  and start to brew my next cup of coffee. but hey  these are the risks when one buys used. returning item tuesday or wednesday per amazon’s approval  thank goodness!
May 28 2020,2.0,4,great when it works  but ours broke/leaks  even the replacement broke.,when this product actually works  it is great. the coffee is delicious  there's so much variety.that said - i could not recommend this product. i gave 2 stars because it's actually a good product when it actually works  but our 1st machine and 2nd machine both started to leak internally.pros:easy to usecoffee is deliciousgood selection of flavors on nespresso.comthe coffee pods are recyclable; nepresso.com even sends you self-addressed envelops to send back the used pods  free of charge.note: i've never used or tasted a keurig so i can't compare with other similar machines. i've had the a mr. coffee for the past 10 years and only switched to nespresso after glowing reviews (and an amazon sale).cons:leaks after a few months!!! our 1st machine leaked  our 2nd (replacment) also leaked!we've bought the nespresso virtuo plus back in december 2019 since it was on sale on amazon.after about 3 weeks  it started leaking at the bottom. it seems like the there was a clog somewhere inside the machine so coffee would get backed up and overflow. we did the recommended cleanings and descaling cleanings as well  but that didn't help.we did an exchange with amazon and got the replacement end of january 2020. it was working beautifully  we did the recommended cleanings as per the manual's schedule. it started leaking as well in middle of may 2020   same issue as the 1st machine.since it's still covered under warranty (1-year manufacturer warranty)  we called nespresso customer support and they walked us through some troubleshooting (use a toothpick to pick out clogs  do a clean cycle with hot water) but it still leaks  so they are sending us a box so we can send back the vertuo plus so they can fix it and send it back. we are potentially without coffee for about 3 weeks so we will be using mr. coffee in the meantime to fill the void.honestly we are expecting the 3rd machine to eventually break  which is a shame because this is a great machine when it works. it's hard to go back to mr. coffee that we are willing to put up with this product as long as the warranty covers replacements but i do not recommend this product.i think alot of the positive reviews are from users who may not have come back to update their initial 4/5 star reviews.please try googling "vertuo plus leaking" as well.
June 16 2020,1.0,8,leak during brewing  support failed to fix,this machine worked wonderfully for about 3 months... it developed a leak during brewing  leaving half the coffee in the cup  the other half on the counter. a google search revealed this problem is very common with the model. sent into nespresso support; they returned it 5 days later with a part replaced. the "fixed" machine sounded like a lawnmower  with loud rattling and vibrating. on the first cup brewed  the machine still leaked - coffee made it to the cup  but now water spilled everywhere. so frustrating... had to buy a new model (evoluo). to nespresso's credit  they credited me the cost of the new machine and sent some coffee pods  too.
November 29 2017,5.0,25,i would easily buy again and look forward to giving a few ...,unreal! i had the previous nespresso machine and this blows the other one away. a bit more for the cups  but so worth it. i would easily buy again and look forward to giving a few for christmas. rich  bold flavor and ease of use are easily the two best features. biggest drawback is the cost of the pods  but still far cheaper than local coffee shop.
October 25 2019,3.0,6,love it  but it's not hot!,i do love this nespresso machine. it's easy to use. the espresso/coffee options are delicious. this is the second nespresso machine i have owned. the first was the original machine  which i had for 7 years! why 3 stars ...while it's nice that this machine has the option to make larger cups of coffee  i would send it back if my old one would magically work again. the reason: i like hot coffee/espresso. it's true the coffee is warm enough (if you want to drink it all immediately)  but it's not hot! in other words  if you want to make your coffee  pour it in a to-go mug  load your things in the car and take the trash out  by the time you pull out of your driveway  you will need to drink your coffee all at once if you want it warm at all. i like to linger over my coffee whether i'm driving to work or reading on a saturday morning. unless you like to linger over lukewarm coffee  this isn't possible. i would absolutely love it if there was a temperature adjustment on this machine. i've had it 2 weeks and am debating about whether or not i want to return it. sadly  i have spent an exorbitant amount of time researching a better  convenient option. i'm not sure what i will do at this point.
November 7 2020,3.0,3,no complimentary gift,i would rate it as a five-star coffee machine  as i don't think any other espresso maker in this prize range (or even much more expensive ones  for that matter) comes even close to  beating the quality of the espresso that this nespresso machine produces. simply delicious and better than even many coffee bars' in the us.however  i took two stars from the review due to what appears to be false advertising: amazon's description states that "each machine includes a welcome kit with a range of vertuo capsules with unique aroma profiles " which would have been fantastic to sample different pod alternatives and find the best ones for my taste. but the nespresso vertuoplus arrived today with no complimentary coffee pods.fortunately  i had ordered some additional espresso pods  or i would have had to wait a week to check how well the nespresso vertuo actually works. minor issue  as i do not think one can complain too much for not getting what  after all  would be a gift. but i think nespresso and amazon should correct the product description
October 20 2020,5.0,4,i'm a believer,i never bought into the "pod" coffee makers (hello planet earth)  but finally got talked into it (thanks instagram influencers - yes  we know you send them free coffee makers to promote it  no secrets here).  this one came with a pod sampler pack which was delightful.  i promptly used my promo code included in the box and ordered 50 pods.  the pods are very expensive (80 cents to $1.80).  hopefully their patent expires and opens up more options eventually.  a lot of reviews said the coffee maker was quiet  but i wouldn't call it that  you can definitely hear it and i would say that it's actually kind of loud.  the milk frother is my favorite part  - do not get the maker without the frother.  half and half works best  and it even heats up the creamer to a pretty hot temperature.  if you're on the fence about getting this  i would say definitely expect to pay more for coffee overall  but it's the price you pay for getting into the nespresso club.
May 2 2018,5.0,18,mmmmmm,i bought this during a holiday special after my 3rd disappointing verismo.  the pods are a little spendy but delicious.  they send you a bag to recycle all of your old pods.  just drop off with ups along side your amazon return 😂.
January 28 2020,1.0,5,just got done making a cup  and i am returning immediately.......,i hesitated on buying this model because i kept reading reviews on lukewarm coffee  but then there were others who claimed their coffee came out hot.  well  i just made three cups  and every single cup came out what i would consider below lukewarm.  i even microwaved my coffee mugs so they were piping hot  and frothed the creamer  and it did absolutely nothing.  as for me and my household  we only do hot coffee  unless we are drinking iced.  i will also note  that when i put the middle pod in  which is an altissio  barely anything happened  a few drops of coffee came out  and that was it.  i’m thinking i may have received a used  or broken machine as well.  when i received my package  it looked like the box was worn  weathered  and previously opened.  the frother also does not do a very good job of frothing.  i have another frother from espressotoria  and it’s amazing.  so  there’s my eperience with nespresso vertuo plus.  i think i will be trying out the ninja coffee bar.
February 5 2021,5.0,2,don’t skip on buying this,i always wait to put up reviews because you should use the product for a while before posting to help buyers decide.  i bought this machine almost a year and a half ago and it is great.  we also bought the glass stand/capsule holder at the same time.  we love coffee in our home and this machine is especially a plus when you have guests and everyone likes different coffees.  it makes an easy fabulous cappuccino with the frother.  we use a standard coffee machine to brew a pot of coffee every morning and use this for our afternoon coffee fix.  i don’t think the pods are expensive considering they cost an average of $1.00 each and you can’t get an espresso or cappuccino for less than $3-$5 and a regular american cup for almost $2. you also have many pod options for strength and taste so there is something for everyone.  it is definitely a good buy.  several of my friends have now bought this machine after having coffee at my place.
March 14 2020,5.0,2,from like to love in one sip. just needs more availability.,i used to like coffee well enough  but i didn’t drink it often  i went elsewhere for my caffeine fix... but i tried a nespresso espresso years ago and never stopped thinking about it  haha.i finally decided to treat myself and now i’m obsessed with coffee. i look forward to waking up to get my espresso fix  and sometimes i even sneak another cup when i get home from work. it’s just completely changed the game for me and i love that they give you a sample pack. the quality of the coffee is just incredible and i’m thrilled with it.those are the pros  but there are some cons.this particular machine worked flawlessly the first couple of uses but now the button isn’t quite responsive and it takes a moment or two for it to start brewing. by that  i mean i thought maybe the water was low  so i went to fill it and half way through filling it the machine started brewing. it was a mad dash to turn it off.next  there’s the matter of the pods. more so the attainability and availability of them. williams sonoma sells the original line but for some reason nestle hasn’t released the the vertuo line to them yet  which  suffice it to say  is stupid.shipping an online order directly from nespresso takes a minimum of 3 business days for my location  which  maybe i’m spoiled by amazon  but not a fan of that.aaaaaand  seasonal creations sell out fast  so you gotta pay attention to those emails  folks. don’t sit on them.also  nespresso boutiques are hard to come by. i live in a major metroplex and there’s only one about 90 minutes from me. if they’re going to be stingy about how many locations they have  why not allow williams sonoma to handle some of that retail?bottom line  it’s decadent coffee but it’s a bit of a pain in the ass to obtain.
October 18 2020,1.0,3,very dissapointing,this is my second nespresso vertuoplus machine. the first machine (purchased november  2019) began leaking coffee during brewing after 3 months use - amazon promptly replaced the unit with a new device in january  2020. the new machine began leaking coffee today  so i spent 62 minutes on the phone with a very patient and helpful nestle associate  but after going through a significant number of repair steps  the machine continues to leak. so nestle's solution is to send me an empty box to return the unit for repair  but they do not have any loaners to use in the meantime! so i have 3-4 weeks of time where i have to buy another coffee machine to use in the meantime!! where is the sense in that. i like the coffee from the vertuo  but the reliability is extremely poor. noting what i know now  i would not knowingly purchase a nespresso machine  nor do i recommend it to anyone else.
August 15 2021,1.0,2,extremely disappointed,wouldn’t recommend this machine to anyone. we have owned ours 4 months and it’s not working at all. the “start” button is mushy  you can’t always tell you pushed it correctly. the owner’s manual isn’t real helpful - very general instructions and didn’t address our problem at all. we looked for videos on our machine to see if we could find something. the one video we found was a man experiencing the same problem  long story short  he didn’t resolve it either.we are having to buy another machine and it was not this brand!
February 2 2022,5.0,0,great set!,i've had these products for three months and used them every morning -- i love not going to s----ucks anymore!  i have had nothing but great results and have not one negative comment about them... i read reviews that said the frother didn't make enough noise so he didn't know it was done - it has a light that goes on when you push the button to start it  and it goes off when it' s done.  i find that the timing of making the coffee and milk frothing is almost exactly the same (open the unit  put new pod in  close unit and as it warms up to start  put milk in frother and the maker is then ready to go - start them both and they finish about the same time.  i find that low fat milks froth just fine despite what other reviews have said (i use 1% most of the time). love that it senses the "size" of the coffee/espresso pods and brews with the appropriate amount of water (you don't have to push a button to choose a size - but you can push the start button again if you want to dilute it).  love that the pods are recyclable and that the company provides postage free collection bags for that.  love the variety of coffees and espressos available (even by the mermaid brand)  and last but not least  i get to think of george clooney every morning as i make my coffee/espresso!  p.s. i recently bought the "double wall glass coffee mugs  (4-pcak) 12 ounces-clear glass coffee cups" so i could see how beautiful the drinks were as they are made  making the "event" each morning even more enjoyable!
August 17 2019,1.0,2,dreadful  bitter coffee every time.  a real disappointment after the classic nespresso machines,i've owned two of nespresso's classic coffee machines.  i like in particular the ability to use refillable coffee capsules  where i can use high quality expresso like intelligensia's black cat beans.  the vertuo coffee system of nespresso was supposed to be an improvement on the classic system.  our experience with this machine has been anything but positive.  my guess is that nespresso is trying to suppress the customization of capsules  and require that all  capsules be purchased directly from nespresso.  so  the idea is that nespresso uses centrifugal forces (high speed spinning) to extract coffee... brewing parameters are adjusted for each capsule  using the barcode data to regulate the flow and volume of water  as well as temperature  infusion time and capsule rotation speed  which is a process nespresso says helps to produce a rich crema.  in fact  this machine consistently produces bitter  foul coffee (but the crema looks good).  cleaning doesn't help  nor does any other adjustment documented in the manual.  you can't buy refillable capsules that allow you to use your own coffee  either ... this is probably the main reason that nespresso switched to the vertuo system.  the older classical system has become hard to find  which was a big reason for taking a gamble on their new vertuo system.
January 14 2021,1.0,3,brews double the amount of coffee,i received my nespresso in the mail today and set it up and used it immediately. i cleaned it like the website said i should before i brewed my first cup. i used the free sample capsules that it comes with. the first one i used was supposed to brew only 7.7 fl oz and i used a 14 oz cup. when it finished brewing the cup was overfilled and spilling everywhere. i didn't add anything to the cup before adding the espresso so i know that it brewed double the amount that it should have. it doesn't give me the option for choosing a brew size so i know i didn't pick the wrong capacity. i tried it again with a capsule that was meant to brew 2.7 fl oz and it filled a third of the same cup so i am left to believe it is my machine that is working incorrectly. i am feeling really frustrated because i was excited to use this for the first time but i am extremely disappointed in the way that it brewed my coffee. the second cup i brewed was really good and the aeroccino worked excellent  i just wish it had brewed the amount it said it would.
September 15 2020,5.0,1,best coffee machine!,i love this coffee machine and i love my coffee now more than ever! this has been the best purchase i made (after snoo) during the difficult time of postpartum.it took me a very long time to choose a coffee machine and i'm glad i settled on this one. i no longer had (and still don't have) the time to use my bialetti  so i needed something to get me good coffee fast and easy with minimum effort and that's what this machine gave me. having read the reviews i was worried about leaking  but i thought occasional leaking was better than underheated coffee every time (like with some other nespresso machines)  because it at least can technically be fixed. but no fix needed  my machine does not leak a bit.i like aflorazio cups made with stevia and nutpods vanilla oat creamer (i have a different brand of frother that i had purchased before my nespresso) - makes great latte! gives me something to look forward to every morning especially now that we have to mostly stay indoors due to the virus and so much smog.
February 10 2022,3.0,1,when it works - it's great,when it works  it makes great coffee.  we purchased this in november of 2021 and have had the machine for just shy of three months.  in the beginning  it worked fine but after about a month  it just stopped working and would blink red when you tried to make a cup of coffee.  at that point  i cleaned and descaled it and it worked again for about another week or so.  then  blinking red light again.  cleaned and descaled another time with no success.  i called nespresso customer care and we got it working  it made two cups of coffee and stopped again.  i didn't have time to call nespresso so it sat on the counter for two weeks and we tried again and had coffee for two weeks.  then  the same issue.  nespresso is now sending us a replacement machine.  this also happened to my daughter's machine so beware this may be a common defect with the machine design.  also  make sure you clean it weekly and eject the cartridge after each use -- this was a tip from the customer care person at nespresso.
January 27 2019,5.0,7,couldn’t beat this sale price!,this is my second nespresso machine and i love it. it’s quiet  easy to use  and doesn’t take up a lot of counter space.  the milk frother is perfect! i actually stopped going to starbucks because i like my mocha cappuccinos better than theirs! i use organic milk  truvia and of course nespresso espresso pods. this machine was on sale before christmas and i couldn’t resist. my 5 year old nespresso machine is in our pantry in the event we may need it. great deal!
August 23 2020,1.0,4,bad product and poor customer service,the unit was less than 6 months old when it started developing a leak. i have emailed their customer service twice and received no response so i had to get amazon rep involved to get a nespresso rep on the phone. after spending an hour on phone  the rep was finally convinced that the unit was defective and told me that the unit would have to be shipped for a repair. she said the repair would take two weeks  not including the time in transit. no loaner unit  or replacement and she insisted that the unit be repaired. now i need to spend next two + weeks with no coffee maker  and nespresso has absolutely nothing to offer.
June 6 2021,5.0,0,must buy if you love your coffee. downside is the cost of pods,we owned a keurig before and i am glad we made this upgrade. i am a coffee drinker and i am fine with using instant coffee throughout the day. this is good when i am craving that good coffee in the afternoon or in the evening after the end of my work day. we have stopped craving starbucks coffee because of this.love the ease of operation and the size. it is much smaller than a keurig machine and looks great in the kitchen. also i love that you can recycle the coffee pods by sending the used coffee pods to nespresso in a postage paid envelope. i love this easy method. with keurig  although you get recyclable pods  you have to separate the coffee  throw it in the regular trash and then dispose the remaining pack in the recycling bin. with this  you dump all the used pods in the postage paid envelope  pack it once its full and drop it at a nearby ups.the only downside if the cost of the pods. it comes to approximately a dollar to $1.5 per cup depending on the coffee and the deals/coupons you get. but this is gourmet coffee and something i drink only once a day (twice if i had a long day). for regular coffee  the instant coffee works for me.but overall worth a buy if you are a coffee lover and want to upgrade your game.
February 14 2022,1.0,0,ridiculously poor product quality,this is our second nespresso by de'longhi purchase in the last two years and definitely our last. our first machine (citiz) began leaking water from the bottom at the one year mark (very gently take care of machine.) when we called in to tech support we were told that it was dead  nothing could be done  and that we could get a 35% discount off a new machine of the same line. not wanting to get another one that would have the same issue  we opted to get the vertuo.the vertuo arrived on sunday and was dead on arrival. the pump will run  but no water moves through the machine and based on the blinking lights  it seems to think that is in descaling mode  but who can tell. i have tried the fixes on youtube  but am exasperated with a new out of the box machine that does not work.i would stay far far away from any of these machines. they appear to have material quality control issues and the response from support is to buy another one...
October 18 2021,1.0,2,only owned for one year before it stopped working...lightly used only 170 cups!,this coffee maker was on a coffee bar in our home and was hardly used. we've run exactly 170 cups of coffee (i reviewed our nespresso orders) through this machine before it stopped working.  our home has a water softener and the water we use is from our reverse osmosis filter. it's ridiculous! if you run the descaling mode  it never stops that mode.  we've run descaling for over an hour  filling the water tank several times  emptying the recipient cup as many. so disappointed. we've had nespresso machines for years...not happy at all with this purchase...avoid!
December 5 2020,1.0,2,do not buy this machine!!!,do not buy this machine!!! first time i had nepresso coffee (expresso) was in the netherlands at a family member’s house. my husband an i loved it! two years later  had the coffee pod version at a friend’s house and decided i would purchase it!  bought it on amazon  everything appeared to be in great working condition. long story short  it leaked all over my counter. a couple of months later  started acting funny and found out it needed descaling. i bought descaling solution from target  hoping this would resolve the issue  but it didn’t. after that  o decided it was taking up too much counter space  so i tossed in the garbage...yes the garbage. after reading reviews on this machine and the response individuals were giving  i thought it wouldn’t be worth my time and effort to ship it in for repair or replacement. totally disappointed!
June 30 2021,1.0,2,broke after 2 months. do not buy,well it made delicious coffee while it lasted!.but now the nespresso vertuo plus has died after just 2 months of normal personal use.completely unacceptable for a product that holds itself out as a luxury item.nestle is sending me a replacement but i honestly question how much i want to keep investing in their system and coffee when i feel i cannot trust it.if you must buy a nespresso  do your homework on the best models  because this is not one of em. or better yet  just learn to make espresso the real way and buy a machine that will outlive us all. no expensive proprietary pod system to buy into either.
October 28 2020,3.0,1,best coffee but substandard protection for shipping,in my opinion  the nespresso is the best coffee around and when my older machine stopped working  i quickly purchased another.i’d have given it 5 stars across the board if not for the horrible shape the box was in and the fact that it looked as though someone sent me a used box and machine.you can see by the photos what sort of shape the insides were in too. to top it off there was no manual. luckily i still had the manual from my old machine.if it wasn’t for the fact that even one day without my nespresso was not something i wanted to endure  i would have sent this mess back.my advice would be to choose the brown box option when ordering. maybe it would be better protected.i also am writing this review as documentation should the machine break or stop working due to the horrible condition it arrived in.
February 18 2022,5.0,1,wow! can’t believe i didn’t buy this sooner!,i am a self-proclaimed coffee snob. i was getting frustrated that at my office i only had a mini keurig and the coffee just tasted horrible.  it took forever to heat up and the coffee was just meh.  someone mentioned the nespresso to me so i took a chance and ordered it. i cannot believe how much better the coffee is! the whole machine is such better quality than the keurig. the way that it heats up the water so fast and disposes of the pod for you is amazing! it is so a much more efficient than the keurig. it’s a gorgeous design and the functionality is impressive. for the price  i cannot believe i hadn’t bought this sooner. it’s amazing!
April 14 2021,1.0,2,terrible machine,i have one nespresso vertuo machine  so i purchased the vertuo plus one for a vacation home.  it didn't work from day one.  nespresso has the absolute worst customer service.  it was defective from the minute i opened the box.  nespresso didn't respond to two complaints and only responded once i wrote on their facebook page.  even then they said they couldn't/wouldn't help me and would defer to amazon's policy for returns.  fortunately amazon took the machine back  although i had to pay a 20% restocking fee.  i continue to enjoy the coffee/espresso from my original vertuo machine  but will not purchase another from them because their customer service is so awful.  do not buy the vertuo plus.  the vertuo is a better machine.
June 20 2020,1.0,6,do not buy!!! it will only work for a few months!!! piece of crap!,i bought this machine in february and now it is not working.  it is a piece of crap.  do not waste your money on this machine!  no customer support!!!  no support from amazon either!  i have just thrown hundreds of dollars down the drain!  do not buy!
April 22 2020,1.0,5,needle broke just outside of warranty...,this product makes a fine cup of coffee/espresso. grand  even. unfortunately for me the needle broke just outside of the 1 year warranty. $125 to whisk away the machine for repair or a 35% discount on a replacement machine (mind you  this discount isn't applicable to the latest machine) for about the same amount. already an indulgent approach to morning coffee  this is an untenable luxury in the post covid-19 hellscape we find ourselves. don't add more uncertainty to your life. it's on to chicory for me. lukewarm regards  nespresso.
September 7 2019,1.0,9,junk!!!!,i can’t tell you how excited i was to get this. and how disappointed i was when it failed. i followed the instructions to clean the machine. nothing. i called support. they walked me through the process. nothing. defective. within 15 minutes. defective. junk. do not buy this thing.
August 9 2021,3.0,2,loved…but lived for the price,we loved our nespresso vertuo machine for a year and some change. but then it gave us the solid red light of death in the middle of a descaling session. support couldn’t help and all the online chatter points to this being a problems for many vertuo owners. i’m sad because i love the coffee and thought it was saving me money…but not if i have to replace it every 1.5 years.
October 26 2021,3.0,0,the electronics controls went wonky after a few months,despite the negative experience with the first unit  i just bough the exact same model to replace it.  but this time i bought the extended warranty.  we'll see if i need it.  the last one started having electrical troubles after a few months  but i was still able to use it.  but it finally stopped working about two weeks after the one-year warranty expired.  i suppose i should have sent it back before one year was up.the unit is quite sturdy mechanically.  it's a bit confusing trying to get it to run the descaling process every few months.  that's partly when the electronics started acting funny.  after that  the status light started showing half red half yellow when it should have shown green when it was ready to brew.  but it still worked  so i ignored the incorrect light status.
December 7 2019,4.0,4,leaks,loved this when we first received it  now it is leaking all over the counter  i read in other reviews that people had this problem   bought it anyway hoping it would not happen to us.  well it did.  i would not buy this brand. (to their credit  nespresso is sending me a new machine and i will return this one. they pay for shipping  they are not sending me the same machine however.)  the coffee is fabulous and i drink decaf everyone seems to like the coffee.  just not the mess it leaves on the counter...  :(**update**  i have changed this to 4 stars!  nespresso is a wonderful company to work with they sent the new machine so far so good.  coffee is worth it!!**
March 9 2022,2.0,0,great coffee but machine is already not working right,this machine makes good coffee! i make the ice leggaro in it every day and it’s been amazing. my main issues come from the machine itself. it is already malfunctioning and i’ve not had it even half a year yet. i’ve had it maybe 2-3 months. when i put the pod in it won’t let me make the coffee. i’ll put the top down and it’ll continue beeping green so then i have to take the pod out and reinsert and i’ll have to redo this process 3-4 sometimes more until it works. this means i’ll have to take the back off so i can catch the pod before it goes with the used ones. it’s just a hassle and not what i expect from a brand new coffee maker. today was the final nail for me writing this review as i opened the machine to make coffee today and yesterday’s pod got stuck on top so i had to remove the back (which had only one used pod in it as i just cleaned it) and then it fell and i was able to put the new pod in and go through with the stupid putting it in  closing machine  having to reopen and catch the pod before it goes to the back  then replace it  hope it works or continue this cycle till it does. i like the coffee this makes and i’m just so bummed by the quality of the machine.
February 25 2022,5.0,0,best coffee you can make at home...,after hemming and hawing over this i pulled the trigger. a great decision. best coffee you can make at home. read a few reviews that said the coffee wasn't hot  which held up my purchase  however it is every bit as hot as my keurig. the milk frother is excellent  if you use half and half there isn't any liquid at all  all froth. as good as keurig is  it can't hold a candle to this. just making regular coffee it's great. a little pricey for a home brew  but a quarter of the cost as starbucks  and is just as good  if you really get into it with flavors and technique  you can beat starbuck's latte's and cappuccinos hands down. if you're a coffee fanatic like me. you'll love this machine.
January 13 2018,5.0,6,great coffee every time!,i love coffee! i have an expensive burr grinder  a top-of-the-line coffee brewer  coffee press  the works. i buy different beans and make my own blends. just so it's clear  i love coffee! so  i was somewhat reluctant to purchase a nespresso when my wife said it's sometimes easier to make just one cup instead of a whole pot when we no one will be home. "that's what they have starbucks for." i argued. but when our frother finally died  i thought it would be a good time to buy the nespresso combo machine plus frother.wow! this thing actually makes great coffee! hot  perfectly brewed coffee! haven't tried all the varieties yet  but intenso and stormio are great. and the frother works very well also. life is good!
August 3 2020,5.0,3,amazing product!,i consider myself a coffee enthusiast. i care a lot about the quality and taste of my coffee. this coffee machine has made my everyday life tremendously more enjoyable. i am pleased with the features of this machine which include: easy access to the water tank  easy touch lever to put the espresso pod in  the fact that it includes the milk frother (big bonus)  and that it makes great tasting coffee. prior to purchasing this coffee machine- i did my fair share of research. something that particularly stood out to me that made me want to purchase the product that made it unique to other coffee machines  is that it uses barcode recognition and a brewing extraction system. there is a different barcode for every different coffee type on each capsule and the machine adjusts the flow and volume of water  temperature  infusion time and capsule rotation to make the best coffee. this was an upgrade from my standard keurig which simply just pushes hot water through the coffee grounds. this product has changed my life!
February 2 2020,1.0,2,lasts maximum 2 years,awesome!  great cup of coffee!  i've made over 60 cups of coffee and no problems. i have also made several cups of home made coffee using the recaps capsule filler and refilled with lavrassa ground coffee.  yum!would purchase again.update:  liked it so much i bought a second one for my other house.  the first one died after 2 years. cleaned and descaled it. only expelled a small amount of water.  so i bought a third unit!  went home to our other house and that unit failed the same way!!!!  i’m now out two units. next fall i will see if my third unit still works.  maybe it has something to do with not using it for 6 months.  i will never buy another!
April 15 2020,3.0,2,it stop working properly after 8 months,i'm making the review 7 months after my purchase because my fairly new nespresso machine started leaking and when i called costumer service for help  they said i would have to send the machine to be fixed which is good  but i was told it would take 7 to 10 days. it has been 2 weeks and i haven't heard anything about it  so i called and was told that it is now going to take 4 to 6 weeks. this is very disappointing since it was not even a year old machine. i was told that nespresso offers loaners but for some reason the company said they can't send me one because they have none to give out. i am now left with lots of coffee pods and no machine. not good costumer service. they actually offered me coffee but i would have to pay for it wow as im telling them i have no machine.
December 10 2018,5.0,1,wow  completely different experience from other "pod coffeemakers","is this a good coffee maker?"  well  that's going to depend upon your expectations in coffee.if you're looking for a "pod coffee maker" that makes normal drip coffee (think keurig) then nespresso is somewhat different  and may or may not meet your expectations.i also have a keurig.  it's just fine for brewing basic  cheap coffee (or more expensive if you buy major-brand-name capsules).  i like my keurig--we've had it for over 5 years  and it works great.  but  those who are environmentally conscious will soon realize that keurig is not recyclable at all  and countless billions of pods a year are making their way into landfills.nespresso's pods are made of 100% recycled/recyclable aluminum.  nespresso is very focused on a goal of 100% recycle-ability  and provides recycling bags with fully pre-paid shipping.  fill the bag (holds about 75-100 capsules)  seal it  and drop it off at your nearest ups store (or nespresso store/kiosk if you happen to have one in a mall nearby).  nespresso will dismantle the pods  collect all the used grounds and process it into compost for landscaping use  and then melt down the pods and recycle them.  100% recycled!all those recycling costs are already built in to the pod cost  so while these pods are more expensive than keurig  there is zero waste as long as the consumer does their job.the best way i can describe nespresso is it's a totally new coffee "experience."  espresso or "foo foo coffee" lovers will likely be very pleased with this machine line.  folks who aren't impressed with anything beyond a drip cup may find nespresso a little "snooty" for them.nespresso's vertuo product produces coffee that is much more similar to a cup of espresso.  the pods are spun at variable rpm's (typically 3000 - 7000rpm) and use "centrifusion" - a made up word intended to commingle "centrifugal force" and "infusion".  basically  they spin the pod  a pump squirts in water  and the spinning forces produce the coffee which is extracted and drips into the cup.  it's not particularly noisy for a kitchen appliance  but you can definitely hear the spinning.  regardless of pod  they all come out with a layer of crema (coffee foam).  there are (at the moment) five "sizes" of pods  which produce 1.5oz (espresso) up through 14 oz ("alto xl").as with any product line  there are pros and cons.  there are some fantastic things about vertuo and a few limitations.pros: absolutely fantastic coffee.  all cups have a crema layer on them  and there are a relatively plentiful number of flavors and intensities available  ranging from lighter and fruitier/acidic flavors all the way up to very dark bold and smoky options.  there are seasonal special pods as well  such as holiday blends or single-origin "master" type coffees.  pods and contents are 100% recyclable.  easy to use out of the box--there's one button.  you press it.  it works.  milk frother (optional add-on  included in our purchase) is fantastic.  i thought it was going to be a gimmick  but i use it with every cup!  it's easy to use  and creates that "latte experience"--it makes better lattes' than a certain really large chain whose name ends with "bucks"--yeah  you'll spend 'em there.  pod cost  compared to an espresso shop brewing an equivalent latte for you  is cheap.  very tightly-integrated recycling: drop pods in bag.  bag full? seal it and drop it off at your ups store.  pre-paid return shipping means zero-extra cost.  done.  milk frother is very easy to clean--takes about 15 seconds  if that.  i've only owned the machine for a month  but the build and overall experience lends itself to belief this is a very high-quality unit.  excellent app (ios/android)---you can view/order/manage pods  accessories  maintenance/cleaning products and subscriptions right from your phone/tablet.  love a particular flavor?  just add it to your cart.  it even supports automatic/routine replenishment if you want that.  seasonal and other specials show up in the app when available  making the app a one-stop-shop.  company is very plugged in environmentally and has created a coffee experience that doesn't fill a landfill.  if you actually play the game the way nespresso intends  it's a holistic coffee experience and a great one at that.cons: no third-party pods  and pods are relatively expensive when compared to other "pod" brewing standards.  you want this machine?  you'll be buying nespresso-branded pods from nespresso  or authorized resellers  and at full-tilt retail which typically runs about $0.90 for an espresso pod and up to $1.20 for their normal coffees (some origins are as high as $2.00 a pod).  so each cup is roughly double the cost of a keurig brew.  there are about 20 different pod flavors and five sizes available  so most people will find something they like  but if you don't love one of the 20  you're out of luck as there are no 3rd-party options without "hacking together" a used pod  some self-ground coffee  and some foil cap stickers you found on the internet.overall  this is an excellent machine for those who want more than a pod of coffee.  i've owned it for a month and i'm 100% hooked.
January 24 2018,5.0,14,if you want quality coffee and espresso  this is the way to go,i bought this because my old nespresso machine (as in really  really old) is finally starting to give up the ghost.  i always wanted the kind that made coffee too but they were simply too expensive in the past for me to consider.finally got one  and love it!  i was a bit worried because apparently some of this line leak  but i have had zero problems with mine so far (i've had it about a week).  i realized that because i usually make a morning latte that has two espresso shots in it (ie. two of the capsules) i would be better off with a machine that makes coffee too  so i got this one.  i love the coffee.  make no mistake:  this machine is nothing like a keurig  and if you like keurig coffee  this is not for you.  this machine makes strong  lucious coffee with crema on the top  which i love  and it also makes espresso.  if you regularly go out for coffee at a place like starbucks or somewhere else that makes fancy coffee drinks  you'll love this  but if you're after the kind of insipid drink that passes for coffee in a lot of the us  this will not be for you.  i had given up on drinking drip coffee completely  because it's usually not strong/tasty enough for me  so i alternate between making a cold brew myself and this machine  and it keeps me going.one small nitpick:  i actually like the espresso from my old machine a bit more  because my old one had no auto-shut off  and i could adjust the strength of the espresso to my own purposes.  i also prefer a bit less crema on my espresso than this makes.  but it's a mild complaint.i'm in love with this machine!
October 29 2020,1.0,4,it was great  at first,the machine was great at first  but two months in  and it's constantly overheating and stuck in descaling mode. i haven't had a decent cup of coffee in weeks  so i'm back to going to starbucks every few days. the only help customer service is offering is to send them my machine for up to 2 weeks  not including transit time. since i have absolutely no intention of going 2-3 weeks without coffee  i will be buying a keurig. the coffee's not as rich but i never had any issues with my keurig machine.
September 15 2020,1.0,4,after 11 months  machine now diverts all nespresso out of back onto counter,despite following all directions for descaling and cleaning  the common problem has no emerged on my machine.  while it technically does still brew nespresso  instead of depositing it in my cup from the spout on the front and prefers to blast it out of the back resulting in a messy counter.  currently waiting on nespresso to contact me back re:warranty.
June 28 2019,2.0,1,mmmmmmm....now i’m not sure it’s worth it!,update 9 months later. now the frother isn’t working properly. it won’t heat the milk any longer and sometimes is difficult to start. i’ll press the button and it will blink and never start. seriously 9 months??? i am the only one that uses it once per day and i follow all instructions to a “t” for cleaning. i’ll reach out to see if i can get help with this but i really expect it to last longer than 9 months....wow  starbucks coffee is a thing of the past now for me! as many have mentioned  the pods are the “worst” part of this system only because they are so expensive. but damn they are good. my drink at starbucks was always soy latte. i have now perfected my homemade soy latte. i use the purple espresso pod and run it through 2 times. then i use original silk soy milk in the frother. add the milk to the double espresso and voila! best soy latte i’ve ever had for just over $1 per day. not cheap but better than $4.50 at starbucks. i’m happy!
September 5 2018,3.0,4,very nice machine  don't like the coffee,this is a very nice machine; the motorized compartment where the coffee pod goes is a fancy touch. the problem was the coffee. i did not like the coffee and my wife only liked two pods. also  the temperature of the coffee was not very hot; it's ready to drink right out of the machine  but by the end of the cup  or if you wait a minute to drink it  the coffee is cold. the milk frother doesn't do well with soy milk  nor does it heat the milk enough either. i did not have problems with the water tank leaking as others have.i would recommend going to a nespresso store a few times and trying the coffee for free  prior to committing to buying the machine.
September 7 2020,2.0,4,buyer beware - 12 months,if you only need a machine for 12 months this is fine. longer than that ... this was my 2nd nespresso machine and now my last. both started massive leaking hot coffee out the back at 14 months. both times customer service told me i was sol. out of warranty.
May 17 2018,5.0,6,5 stars isn't enough!,this is everything i wanted my kuerig to be  and more. god i love using this thing. you want quality espresso? check. you want a quality cup of coffee to jump start your day? check. you wanna mimic that $10 cup of coffee you get at starbucks  and then some? check! checks all around. hell  they even give you recipes on their website so you can spice things up a bit! i can't recommend this thing enough. oh and the drinks come out so nice and fancy looking. i feel a little bit more and more like clooney every time i brew a cup!
April 24 2019,5.0,0,love it  robotic head lifting is nice  and disposal is easy,2-year edit: unit has started to leak underneath. contacted nespresso is no help. they will have you go through the long-drawn-out cleaning  and doesn't fix a thing. they want you to empty the pods each time. don't leave them in the catch container  or they will drip.edit: flavors  oh man  you have to try the caramelizio  bianco leggero (over milk) and the bianco forte (over milk)makes good coffee  i'm still searching for the perfect flavor  but the machine itself is a work of art. i love the mechanical head lifting and how it disposes of the used capsule to it's container held in the back. it's actually pretty high-tech  so if anything malfunctions  there is an easy way to reset it without issue.your machine may need to be reset to its factory settings  to correct the amount of water dispensed through your capsules. to return to factory settings  we recommend the following steps:tap the lever upward  to eject any used capsule from the capsule chamber  then tap the lever downward  to close the head of the machine.push the lever down for approximately 3 seconds  until the green light goes out  to turn off the machine.press and hold the coffee button and lever down  simultaneously  for approximately 3 seconds  until the light is steady orange  then release the lever.press the lever down 3 times. the light should start blinking quickly in a pattern of 3 blinks and a pause.once the blinking pattern is established  press and release the coffee button.the light will blink 3 times slowly  to confirm the reset  then turn a steady green.
April 14 2020,1.0,3,won’t last you 3 months.,great little machine  unless you want it to last more than 3 months. a little after the 3 month mark  coffee started spilling over everywhere. i ran the cleaning cycle  changed the pod size  moved it to another location... we tried everything. nothing fixed the problem. i don’t know why i didn’t buy the breville brand. we have 2 other breville cappuccino machines. and even with daily use 2 or 3 cups  we’ve had no issues.
May 12 2020,5.0,1,great machine  however compared to the black vertuo plus  not as good of quality of components,the machine itself is awesome  however i returned this color because it is not as pictured and not as nice qualityi ordered the black one and returned this one  for the following differences:black has actual chrome - heavier pieces and nicer quality than the grey plasticblack was shipped the bigger water capacity tank  the grey  although it stated same  was shipped with smaller capacityblack has a better on button with chrome where the grey one had plastic.the overall quality of the grey was not consistent with the online description  nor as good of quality components.  i suspect the red would be similar to the grey quality.
October 5 2020,5.0,1,amazing coffee machine (better than keurig!!),i've have a keurig but the coffee always tasted watery and just not at all like cafe style coffee. i even bought a make-your-own-k-cup so i could use better quality coffee and it still did not make good coffee. this nespresso machine is pure magic! the coffee is amazing!the nespresso machine has excellent coffee capsules and works way better than any keurig i've ever used. it even came with like sampler 10 pack of capsules to try their popular flavors. i bought the red machine only version (if you were curious). no issues so far but i'll update if anything comes up.
November 16 2021,1.0,2,stopped working after 10 uses,stopped working after a month  not sure why but i have called customer support and the only option is to pay repair cost that is nearly as much as machine or take a 35% discount on new model.  we used this thing for a month but were unable to get a hold of support and eventually gave up.  i got it for my wife's birthday gift last year.  when i talked to them today they walked me through the reset options which i had already found online and then said i had a faulty button and need to order a new machine.  not impressed as i have 40 pods i can no longer use after using this only 20 times.
August 9 2020,2.0,3,missing "welcome package",i was so excited at how quickly this shipped as i have been without a coffee machine for quite some time. however  upon arrival i open the box and no coffee pods..this is really disappointing since it says in the description that it is included. i purposefully didn't order extra because i wanted to try and see which one i liked best. contacted seller and hope to hear soon and hoping it is just a mistake and not that i got a dupe product. deciding on just getting it from the store since it is back in stock and just sending this item back. very frustrated. the only reason it gets two stars is because the machine itself is beautiful and shipping was quick.
October 23 2021,4.0,0,directions are very scarce  have to plug the machine in to get the door to open,dislike: the  written instructions and online instructions are very vague.  one important thing they neglect to tell you? you have to plug the machine in to get the top door to open.  in many other coffee machines  the doors open without any power. this machine you have to plug it in for anything to work including the doors.  the instructions are written in several languages  are hard to read   and mostly only have pictures with few words.the flavor from the coffee and everything else is fine. just beware if you think you can just figure this machine out in 10 minutes.
August 20 2019,5.0,1,fast  reliable  tasty  recyclable.,this is a great machine. it makes my espresso daily my wife coffee and decaf. i appreciate that it automatically detects whatever type of pod is inserted and adjusts the water accordingly. the used pods are recyclable  so we just bag them up and send them back to the manufacturer (free postage)  so this product generates no trash beyond the packaging it ships in. it’s easy to clean and maintain; we’ve had no problems in 8 months of daily use. the pods cost about 85 cents each  which is a little more than the grounds for a conventional espresso machine  but it takes no time to prepare or clean up.  we’re all busy  and no one wants to spend three minutes washing coffee grounds out of all the crevices of their machine. this simplicity  speed  and cleanliness makes the nespresso a great value.
December 12 2020,2.0,2,i love this coffee  but ..... won't last,the good news  nespresso has the best customer service i have ever experienced. unfortunately  i have lost faith in this product. i bought this one year ago and loved everything about the coffee! i was thrilled. four months later it  died  but i called customer service and they sent me a new one. three months later that one broke and they wanted me to send it in for repair but i asked for a new one and they obliged. five months later that one died. i am waiting for their box to send it in for repair  but this is nuts. three machines in a year!!!!! i am so bummed. if you do purchase this  open an account with nespresso on their website so you get the great customer service. plus  when you buy pods from them directly  they send you free stuff to start and free samples every time  plus you can only get the recycle bags from them directly. free shipping over $100  scheduled delivery  and you can return unopened packages. i hope they get it together ... but when this one dies  i am done. good luck.
March 29 2020,5.0,1,super impressed!,i finally took the plunge and was very skeptical after a terrible experience with a different brand of pod-coffee maker ;) wow this machine is amazing. the flavor is delicious  it's easy and well thought out. i can't say enough good things. i was a bit worried about the coffee temp as i've seen some reviews that say the coffee is only lukewarm but that has not been my experience. all of my pours have been piping hot.i've only had it a week but i'm in love. i was paying $4 a day for my coffee habit prior to purchasing this machine so the cost of the pods don't bother me and i really enjoy that there's essentially no clean up. the ease of use is totally worth the need to buy pods. so far  they've all tasted great as well.
November 5 2019,3.0,1,lid didn’t close. got a replacement. so far so good.,update 11/20/20: i received my replacement from amazon. so far so good. coffee tastes great. the foam is something to get used to. i didn’t know the machine came with a sample pack of coffee so that was a nice surprise to try different varieties before committing to a specific roast.—-i was craving my first cup of nespresso coffee all day. i came home  went through the cleaning process  opened the lid back up and inserted a pod and now it won't close. called nespresso directly  was on hold for about 10 mins and the tech finally told me its probably defective and to return the machine. big disappointment so far. now i need to somehow return the machine but still need to figure out how to close the lid first!
May 18 2021,1.0,1,only lasted 45 days!!!,my nespresso vertuoplus machine quit working after 45 days of using it only once a day. now it doesn't brew using the proper amount of water resulting in quite a mess on my counter top  i contacted customer service through amazon and because it was outside the 30 day return window they could only refer me to the delongi website to be told i could not get a replacement for 3 months due to a computer chip shortage. my coffee pods will be old by then!  very frustrated and disappointed.
January 23 2022,5.0,2,this is a wonderful step up from the early nespresso machines,they have removed all previous flaws from the early nespresso machines and came up with a delicious  quiet  easy to use  and attractive little coffee machine. love it !
December 7 2020,5.0,1,loving it!,very easy to use! the milk frother is the star of the show!! works so well and is so easy to use and really elevates the cappuccino experience! didn’t realize this came with a variety pack of coffee pods so that was a fun surprise that we got to try a variety of coffee types! interesting that it senses the size of the coffee/espresso pod that you insert. so there are bigger vertuo pods for coffee and smaller for espresso. also be careful when buying pods  the vertuo pods are different than some of the other nespresso machines.
August 17 2021,1.0,3,stopped working after one month,my machine gave the overheating red light after using for a month. nespresso recommended returning the machine but the seller is not accepting refunds. do not buy from this seller!
December 19 2018,3.0,5,great coffee  but avoid vertuo  & stick to original machines (temperature  capsule availability),i bought this model because  unlike the 'original' nespresso machines  this new vertuo models have capability of brewing regular 'drip-style' coffee.  however  i was soon disappointed.  the coffee temperature is much lower than the original machines.  i believe this is a known  due to the type of brew process (not using pressure but centrifuge instead).  in fact  if you read the user manual troubleshooting guide  under the 'coffee is not hot enough' section  it tells you to pre-heat water before putting it into the container.  im still suprised that i pay >$100 for a coffee machine  and still have to use my microwave to get hot coffee.  also its impossible to buy vertuo capsules in stores.  and buying from amazon  you can only buy a 30-pack quantity.  my advice is to buy the original model nespresso machine  and get 'coffee' pods  instead of pure espresso pods.
July 13 2021,1.0,1,keeps overflowing and sometimes the lid randomly wont open,i have had nothing but problems with this machine ever since i bought it. it worked fine for a few weeks but after that the lid won't open sometimes for 10 minutes at a time. it at least once a week will just endlessly pour water into a cup when i am trying to make coffee and the only way to stop it is to unplug it. not sure what the problem is but i do not recommend this product at all.
December 21 2021,3.0,2,whipped crema,for the average coffee drinker  nespresso hits the mark. quality machine. coffee tastes good  but when it comes to espressos  not there. the crema or foam is  artificially created through a centrifugal process.
December 29 2021,1.0,1,do not buy,cannot recommend not buying this product enough.purchased in july  broke in october. wouldn’t even turn on. they offered to fix it. they had it for four weeks. get it back and it works for five days before breaking again. turns on but doesn’t make any coffee.asked for a new machine and they said i can either get if fixed again (no thank you) or purchase a new machine for 35% off. so insulting. then they said a man would pick it up to fix it. no name  no number  no idea when he would show up. no one ever called.terrible customer service and several of my friends are experiencing it breaking within months as well.will be selling all my pods and buying a completely different brand.
November 18 2021,4.0,0,delicious coffee but it's noisy,i've only had my nespresso machine for a short time but i am in love with it already. i did watch a lot of youtube videos instead of reading the pamphlets and it's so easy to use! i also love the frother  it's so easy to use and i can now make hot milk without having to use my stove/microwave. i also love that this machine has a self cleaning mode!!!the only thing i have noticed is how loud the machine is. maybe it's because i'm still getting used to this machine opposed to a keurig  but it's a very minor thing. overall i still highly recommend this machine  and all of the flavors nespresso has is just amazing so i'm excited to try them all!
October 12 2021,5.0,2,my third purchase as a gift!,i was served an odacio coffee from nespresso when as a guest at a friends home.  i had a nespresso machine delivered to my home that very day.  as a result of serving this coffee i have sold at least four machines by referral.  we have one in each home and guest cabin.  we even take it traveling.  expensive? yes!  worth it?  heavens yes!
February 27 2022,1.0,1,not happy at all,when i received this product it looked like it had been previously opened i confirmed that when i called nespresso for instructions to use the machine since they were missing from the package. nespresso confirmed that a sample package should have been included. it was then that i realized the machine was used because when i ran the first brew with just water to clean it  it seemed odd that coffee grains washed up on a new machine. i don't typically write reviews however this is truly upsetting and requires attention. amazon should not be sending out used merchandise and if they do  they should at least let the buyer know  that its used allowing them to make the decision if they want that product.
May 2 2020,1.0,5,stopped working after 4 months!,gave this as a christmas gift to my husband in december 2019  now 4 months later its leaking and useless and i'm stuck with hundreds of dollars worth of nespresso unless i buy another one..... hmm? maybe buy directly from nespresso next time?
January 9 2021,1.0,3,maybe would be a good product if it worked?,i received my machine this week. i would love to know about how it brews  but my main button is broken. i’ve done troubleshooting  followed manuals and videos  wasted endless expensive pods.. and nothing. extremely disappointing purchase.
January 13 2022,3.0,0,great cup of coffee  but.......,.....it's not very hot and cools down rapidly. and after making a cup  it drips. it drips  and it drips. i keep a piece of paper towel on the mug platform so i don't have to keep rinsing it.that being said  it produces an amazing cup of coffee! the espresso is as good as my $500+ breville espresso machine with less preparation and clean up even with the dripping. the taste is way better than the keurig i replaced with it although the keurig was easier to use.
