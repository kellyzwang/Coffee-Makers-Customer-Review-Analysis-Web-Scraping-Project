April 20 2016,5.0,6020,tips that work!  from an average person  not a barista.,i'll give tips after a little background info  what wasn't right and what customer service said to do  that worked!first off my background.  i am not  nor have i every been a barista.  i am an average person who likes mochas from the coffee shop  but i live 80 miles from town  so i don't get them very often and wanted to try making them at home.  this is my first espresso machine.  i read a lot of blogs and watched online videos from real baristas giving tips how to make good espresso drinks at home before purchasing this.  i got this thing and things didn't taste right to me  bitter.  so i did more research and figured out the problem  it wasn't heating up well.  i checked temperature and it was only getting to 157*f on average (too cold) and took 14-15 seconds to make one shot (too fast).  not what the online advice says you need.  online advice says 170-180*f and 27-30 seconds is about right.  so i called mr coffee for help before i sent it back to amazon.  glad i did.the call: in short  customer service told me to run a cleaning cycle per directions from page 16 in the user manual.  which is 1/2 tank of white vinegar  hit the button for double shot.  repeat as many times as you need.  also run a cleaning cycle through the milk dispenser.  my thought was  "what the heck  its a new machine!  i did the priming as directed before use  how can it be dirty?"  but i had to give it a try or send it back.  well i'll be go to heck  it worked!while directions said you only need to run it few times.  i had the time  so i ran the whole 1/2 tank white vinegar through (double shot at at a time) since i has to toss the vinegar anyway  so why not really clean it eh?  anyway  after a couple times running the double shot espresso button the temperature went from consistent 157*f to 175-182*f.  wahoo!  it seemed to matter how long i let it warm up between shots.  running two times consecutively got the 175-177*  which is just what you want.  letting it sit and warm up a few minutes before runs got it 180-184*  which is getting a little too hot.  btw  i was using a good quality quick  calibrated thermometer that i use for caramel making  which is a very exacting process to do right.  so i figured it could accurately measure the espresso before it cooled from air temperature  which by the way is mere seconds i found out.note:  the higher temperature is not for drinking comfort (how hot you like it) it is what the espresso needs to properly extract and not be bitter.  you can let it sit a few minutes if you don't like it that hot  personally i don't want a burned tongue  so i wait a little.  coming out of the machine perfect drinking temperature is not a good thing.second note:  running the vinegar through is not descaling  it is cleaning.  descaling is something else you do  read the manual on how.  the vinegar clean is not priming  it is cleaning.  don't know why you need to clean the new machine in addition to priming  but do it anyway.  make sure to rinse the reservoir out  then run some plain water through to remove the vinegar afterwards  do it as many times as it takes to get the smell out  mine took a full reservoir.  honestly though it's faster shipping it back and waiting for a replacement machine because it doesn't get hot enough  this works.when i first got it  as i said it was taking 14-15 seconds to run the shots through.  during the cleaning process they got longer and longer.  now that it's clean  it's about 28-30 seconds.  again  just what you want.  i use my cell phone stop watch feature to be accurate.in summary  based on what i've read and how i got it to work well  at least for "normal" person standards.  this a good machine.  here's my tips to get it working right:1.  learn to grind grounds well.  do not buy pre-ground  buy beans and grind them yourself.  it has to do with when the oil is release one how well it works.  if you are going to the trouble to use a machine like this (rather than just normal a coffee machine) you can go to the effort to grind as well  it's just part of the process.you can use the hand held cone burr grinders for the most accurate fine ground.  or you can spend a bundle on an electric burr grinder.  from what i read  you really do need to get a good one if you go electric.  in fact that is almost more important than the machine they say.  inconsistent size of grounds will yield inconsistent shots.  too fine (turkish grind  which is like flour) and it clogs the filter making the machine unable to push all the water through.  too course (regular coffee machine grind) and the water goes through too fast making it bitter.  espresso grind has to be the consistency of table salt.i'm cheap  so using the hand grinder does work and i advise it for other cheap people.  however   in the morning i am cranky and impatient  i'm also lazy  so i've ordered a couple different electric burr grinders to see if that works as well.  i plan to return which ever (or both) that don't grind as the espresso needs (good ol amazon prime and their return policies).  no  i did not take the online baristas advice and buy a $200 burr grinder (i am cheap after all)  but i did spend about $50 on a burr grinder and $20 on a blade style.  will update when i have decided what works or not  which i kept or if i end up just doing the hand grind.2.  learn how full to fill the cup.  at least to the top of the rim  or a little higher.  you want the end result about 1/8-1/4" from the top.  the amount in the cup does matter.3.  learn how to pack your grounds to 30lbs of pressure.  how to do that  put your bathroom scale on the counter.  use your tamper to push until you get the feel of 30lbs pressure.  repeat several times until you can push it pretty accurately.  this is very important.  also  but a metal tamper  the plastic one isn't sturdy enough for 30 lbs pressure  it bents and packs unevenly.  you can get metal tampers cheap  it's worth it.4.  before you make your cup each morning  warm the machine as directions indicate  but also run a shot of plain water through first.  the second time through will be hotter  and it only takes 30 seconds.5.  even though it's a new machine  and you did the priming as the manual says  run 1/2 tank of white vinegar through it (directions on page 16 of manual) and it will make a tremendous difference.  don't argue  just do it.6.  you can open the lid and fill the reservoir with it on the machine with a pitcher if taking it on and off is too hard.note:  i did not receive this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  this is a good machine for the average espresso based specialty coffee drinker.  i gave it a full 5 stars because it's pretty idiot proof (i'm not the most mechanical person) and it makes mochas that are pretty darn good in my average persons opinion.  i have no idea what a real coffee expert would say  and really  shouldn't they have a professional machine anyway?

October 3 2017,3.0,1141,dangerous design flaw drops metal screw into coffee,i love my mr coffee cafe barista. it makes great espresso  cappuccino  latte  etc.however  there is a dangerous design flaw that needs to be fixed asap. there is a tiny wood screw holding the 3 pieces of the portafilter together. this tiny wood screw works its way out of the plastic piece and falls into your coffee!i discovered this when i poured a shot of espresso into my new $215 nutri ninja auto-iq blender to make a bulletproof coffee. the tiny screw tore up the metal blades before i realized what was happening and turned it off. i guess i am lucky because ordinarily i would have just gulped the shot and the screw would have ended up somewhere in my digestive system.when i fished the screw out i couldn't imagine where it had come from. i saw the tiny hole in the bottom of the portafilter but i just could not believe that mr coffee was using a wood screw into soft plastic to hold the portafilter together! especially when  as was bound to happen  if it worked its way out  it would end up in the coffee! but later when i was cleaning the portafilter i saw that it came apart into 3 pieces and it had never come apart like that before. i had saved the little screw and i saw that  incredibly enough  this was what had been holding it together!i have included pictures showing the pieces of the portafilter and the tiny screw that is supposed to hold all it together. the translucent thing is a seal between the other 2 parts. the red arrows point to the places where the screw goes.mr coffee needs to fix this issue and provide a free replacement portafilter to everyone who owns a cafe barista.if you own or buy a cafe barista i urge you to be proactive and remove the little screw before it works its way out on its own and you end up drinking it. the portafilter leaks and drips without the screw but that's better than having metal pieces in your coffee.
September 26 2017,1.0,589,worked amazingly well...for two months,so i'm really sad to write this review. if you had asked me for a review during the first month of use (3 double shots brewed daily) i would have rated this machine 5 stars but after less than two months of use this machine will no longer brew espresso.  the pump starts to sound like it's working and then goes quiet when it starts to "brew" and nothing comes out. prior to this issue the machine made the sound the entire time the espresso was brewing. i followed the manufacturers instructions to ensure the porta filter was not clogged. i've let vinegar sit and ran vinegar through the unit a few times to "delime" it as mr. coffee suggested in their response email to my complaint with no success. i've wasted a ton of espresso trying the unit again after each unsuccessful "fix". there is no reason for an espresso machine (for whatever reason) to stop working in two months. i'll update this review after i have time to sit on the phone with mr. coffee as they walk me through more "fixes" for a two month old machine. can you tell i'm not pleased?
June 13 2017,4.0,321,amazing convenience - great caffe!,while shopping for an espresso machine  i went back and forth on this machine and a similarly priced delonghi. i came very close to choosing the delonghi  but what pushed me to the mr. coffee was my intended use.  i wanted something that was very automated  while still allowing the freedom to use my own ground  not pods.my out of the box experience was that the item was simple to unpack and prep for use.tip: this ships in it's product box  so if you want extra protection or this is a gift  check off the "ship in an amazon box" where offered.  after setting up the maker  washing it's compartments etc. i was ready to prime it.  this took just a few minutes.the unit comes with all you need - just add electricity  water  milk  and coffee.  it includes a water tank  milk tank  two filers (single and double)  a porta-filter and combination scoop/tamper.  it has a 26" cord and is 1 040 watts.  it is advertised as 15 bars.the unit heats up quickly and is easy to use.  the advertised drink sizes are pretty accurate  so choose the right glassware!  you can also make custom sizes by overriding the espresso button.tip: consider buying another filter so you can prep two or three filters with coffee and make several drinks faster when serving a small group.the drinks you can make are:* espresso:  single (1.25 ounces) double (2.5 ounces)* cappuccino:  single (6 ounces) double (10 ounces)* latte:  single (12 ounces) double (15 ounces)tip:as far a tip on glasses  i ended up buying:  * bormioli rocco easy bar espresso glasses - these are too small for a double espresso.  they claim they are 3.5 ounces but actually measure out to be 2.5 ounces filled to the brim. * bormioli  rocco oslo cappuccino cup - excellent glass and at 7.5 ounces easily fits a single cappuccino and allows for extra froth. * anchor hocking glass mugs - about 16 ounces and great for lattes and the double cappuccino.the mr. coffee heats quickly  and each set of lights pulsates until at a ready temperature.the entire setup is simple to use  add water  add milk to the froth container  add your coffee and you are ready to go.my lone complaint about this product is the porta-filter.  i find mine requires an abnormal amount of strength to lock it into position.  i am not overfilling with coffee  and even tried it with empty filters inserted in the porta-filter- same problem.  i actually ordered a replacement machine but had the same issue.other than that quirk  it is really a great machine.  it makes excellent drinks  and with minimal effort on your part.  you can customize your froth simply by using the cappuccino button override.  after you are done making drinks  clean up is easy.  you can store your froth container of milk for later use in your fridge.  to clean up  just set the froth dial to 'clean' then hold down the latte button to override drinks and put the machine in "clean" mode.basically  outside of the on-off button on the side  you do everything with three buttons (espresso  cappuccino  and latte). press once for a single drink  twice for a double  and hold down the buttons to override (custom drink size  extra froth  and clean).there are little tray areas you can pull out or remove  depending on your glass sizes.  you can also fit the smaller filter in one of these tray compartments when not in use.  do not leave the porta-filter attached to the machine when not in use  as this may add wear to the filter assembly.i would absolutely recommend this machine.
March 16 2018,3.0,191,decent quality expresso  poor milk froth,i've had a semiautomatic espresso maker/machine for the last five years. i've brewed about 4600 cups of espresso with it. with that said i have some idea of what a good espresso shot is about.first off  this machine requires a thorough cleaning before you use it. one other person recommend cleaning it with vinegar  and this seem to help.in order to produce a good espresso shot  you need to have the right amount of coffee  the right amount of pressure for tamping  and finally a length of time for brewing that is not too long or too short. get one of the variables wrong  and the quality suffers. lastly  a good-quality blend of coffee. i use a local roasting house  and coffee that's about $17 a pound. avoid the cheap supermarket stuff  and go to a local roaster.if you use the enclosed spoon you'll get somewhere around 11 or 12 g of coffee. most sources i've read recommend between 14 and 18 grams  so you'll want to use a rounded spoonful.  you'll also need about 30 pounds of pressure for tamping  and  the enclosed tamper they give you will bend under that kind of pressure  and will probably result in uneven compression. (hint--buy a steel tamper!). no professional uses a plastic tamper. if you get about 14 to 15 g of coffee in the porta filter   then brewing time is around 25 seconds   which is just about perfect.  this produces nice crema.  i preheat the machine on mine by running a double shot through the porta filter while empty  then wiping dry   and finally go on to making the cup of coffee.  if you follow these steps you can produce a pretty decent shot.as to the milk frothing mechanism   i think it's a joke.  i can make a wonderful froth  from about 4 ounces of milk  and  this uses way too much milk.  i want to taste coffee not milk.  i guess if you like lattes   that you may like the frothing part.  i use a standalone frother  and  find it a whole lot more economical and easier to clean.  by letting it sit for about 30 seconds i can get the perfect blend of milk and froth for cappuccinos. there's less control with the built in one mr. coffee uses. i can also say it's a pain to clean this built in one  and residual milk tends to build up on the plastic if you let it sit. again  i'm much happier using a standalone frother  and they are only about 30 bucks to buy.i also picked up the mr. coffee burr grinder  and it seems to produce a nice grind for this machine  and also seems consistent in its output. the two seem a nice match for one another.i think the week part of this whole system is the frothing. as an espresso maker  i think it does a fine job. quality is not quite as good as my semiautomatic machine was  but decent for the price. i paid about $147. price seems to go up and down a lot on amazon. currently it's $181. not sure i'd pay that much for it.time will tell just how good of a value this is  but pump seems to be quite capable  and i'm told you can order parts for it  which is more than i can say for a lot of the machines out there. packaging was outstanding. probably something we all take for granted these days until you get something that arrives in pieces. i admire a company who takes the time to engineer a good packaging system  and mr. coffee did it right. the machine comes well protected  even the plug receptacle end is protected. nice.overall i think it's a good machine  but again i would recommend a standalone frother for best results and economy.one other thing worth mentioning is you can get this machine for about $70 without the milk frother  and that's what i would do. i found after trying the frothing a few times my coffee taste like milk  and is on the warm side instead of hot side. i don't see any reason to pay for something that is really subpar  so again  if i had to do over i would just buy the standalone machine without frother.update: tried the milk frother a few more times  and it overflows a 12 oz. cup every time  and froth is pretty loose. foam should be dense. i now run a double shot of water through before i brew  and this helps with temp  but milk frothing is still sub-par imo. i think i will send back  and just get the $70 version. a stand alone frother works much better  and is consistent with nice dense foam/froth.
March 8 2017,5.0,586,i don't know how i managed without it.  read on for cup sizing details  cleaning  etc :),several days i spent reviewing 'all in one' espresso machines  and there's a lot to filter through (get it? ah my jokes are too corny anyhow).  after doing a heavy amount of research i was satisfied with this choice.  took me a few weeks to pull the trigger  but i couldn't be happier that i did.  i was addicted to kwik trip lattes  starbucks lattes  anyplace that has a latte you name it.  i'm quite positive this has already paid for itself by not having to go to all those places.but let's talk more about the thing!it's kind of big but it has its own dedicated spot in my kitchen.  it's nice enough to be left out and not have to store away in a cabinet.  what i really like about it is that it's pretty much an all in one system without the thousand dollars plus all in one cost.  i push one button and all the magic happens  and it's quite entertaining to watch the espresso cascade through the milk and create separate layers.  i also like that i can take the milk and store it in my fridge.  i've done some temperature tests and only noticed a 5-degree increase after making a double latte before i put it back in the fridge.  this is nice as you would think to be so close to all that heat it would be a much bigger temperature fluctuation.  just make sure you put the blasted spout up otherwise you'll have a fun time cleaning up a giant mess of milk.  i really wish there was some sort of sensor that assisted with this issue as i guess i'm stupider than i thought when it comes to lifting that lever.for anyone who wanted to know  it fits a full-sized pint glass underneath it if you remove the drip tray.  it is a tight fit as you will have to angle the pint glass to slide it in but i use pint glasses for my large lattes consistently.  the latte puts out almost double the amount of milk that the cappicino does.  i think all single servings should be able to fit in your regular sized coffee mug.another aspect i really like is the cleaning aspect.  just hold the top button for the coffee grind connector (w/e you call it) to get cleaned and hold the bottom button for the milk frother to get cleaned... that's pretty simple!  i did notice that the milk froth cleaner doesn't get all the milk out of the metal tube  but since it slides right off and is pretty easy to clean it's not that big of a deal to me.so ultimately how does this compare to all the places i regularly go to?  it's spot on.  sure it's not the sugar loaded 1500 calorie starbucks grade latte  but as far as the espresso taste goes it's very close.  i actually prefer not adding any sugar or other diabetes contributing nonsense half these latte makers add and find this is a much healthier option for me as well.if you enjoyed my review please like it.  cheers!
March 20 2019,5.0,95,delicious  foamy lattes with one button!,this little machine was a game-changer for me. i spent weeks researching espresso machines and chose this one for 1) ease of use/cleaning 2) price 3) latte focused. two months later  i have been consistently blown away on all three! for those who say it’s wears after some use  are you cleaning it properly? cleaning is super easy and i do it after each use and have had zero issues. you just turn the nob to “clean” and then hold down the latte button until the cleaning cycle begins. it self cleans with just one button and i have never had any issues. also make sure to keep the water up! as long as you’re following the cleaning directions  you should have no problems!i have tried it with both almond and regular milk and find that i get the best foam with 2% regular milk or califia’s almond barista milk in the blue box.i moved from a bustling neighborhood with lots of coffee shops and i was certain i would miss it...i don’t! this machine saves me money and time  and the lattes are easily as good as the ones i would buy.highly recommend!
September 4 2017,1.0,170,inconsistent and dangerous!,i bought the mr. coffee café bistro about eight months ago.  at first it was fun and worked fairly well  though very inconsistently.  i never knew just how much coffee it would give me.  without changing the amount of foam desired   i could run a large and get a super small amount  or run a small and get a mug that was overflowing   i used the machine on average once to twice a day following all directions for use and cleaning. the machine was never used to make multiple consecutive coffees.  two weeks ago  the coffee became much hotter than it had always been  and clear extremely hot water dripped constantly whether the machine was on or off!  based on my experience  the mr. coffee café bistro seems inconsistent at best and dangerous at worst! hope this is helpful.
January 16 2018,5.0,99,the results are worth a little effort,by the time i bought this espresso maker  i had already gone through many different coffee and espresso machines. a friend raved about the nespresso systems but i had used a keurig for a few years and was done with the whole pod system  which seems wasteful and expensive  plus it was hard to keep it clean from icky sludge that formed in the water dispenser. another friend raved about the breville but the cost of that was way over my budget. this mr. coffee machine had great reviews and the price was good  so i decided to give it a try.i've waited to write this review until i had some time to really get to know this machine and i can tell you i absolutely love it.the espresso  cappucino  and lattedrinks i've made have all been delicious. the espresso comes out dark and rich and even has that crema top to it when the shots are finished pouring. there are two options: a single or a double filter and i always use the double. for milk  i use almond or rice milk and the froth on the cappuccino is great! the bubbles aren't as fine and "creamy" as you would get from a professional machine at an espresso bar  but the results are still delicious and impressive. the machine dispenses the milk first  then adds the shots of espresso  so i sometimes stir it after it's done to totally mix the espresso (especially if you add sweetener). there is definitely an advantage to using the right grind for the coffee beans. be sure your beans are ground for espresso. i had used beans ground for pour over coffee and the espresso was watery.the machineif you are looking for a brew-and-run system  this isn't your machine. but the time and effort you spend is honestly not that big of a deal and the results are worth it. take a cappuccino  for instance. here's the process. first  fill the water container with water and place on the back of the machine. turn the machine on (it takes a few minutes to warm up). next  fill the milk container with your type of milk  place the top on  be sure the setting is set to "cappuccino"* and insert the unit into the machine. next  take the "porta-filter" and place a scoop of coffee into it  tamping down firmly with the tamper on the other end of the scoop. insert the filter into the machine. place a large cup under the filter (there's a pull out stand for a small cup but i rarely use that)  make sure the silver tube (dispensing the milk) is pointed into the cup (yes  i've forgotten that and dispensed milk all over the counter by accident)  and then press the cappuccino button twice (for a double). the machine goes to work  first dispensing the milk  then the espresso. you'll know it's working because it is loud.after you've enjoyed your cappuccino  there are a few things you need to do to "clean up" and be sure the machine is ready for the next time. first  remove the porta-filter and dump the used grounds (they go into my counter-top food scraps bin). rinse out the filter  and then place back on the machine and press the button for a single shot of espresso. this rinses out the espresso parts of the machine. i then remove the filter  take it apart under cool running water  and let it dry. for the milk container  turn the setting to "clean " place a cup under the metal tube  and press the "clean" button (it's the latte button  pressed and held for a few seconds until the "clean" function turns on).  now  the tube is clean and you can either place the container in the fridge (if there's milk left over) or rinse/wash and let it dry. does this sound like a lot? it doesn't take long and it just becomes part of the process. again  the results are worth it.*as you can see from above  after you've cleaned the milk container  you have to turn the knob back to cappuccino or latte. if you forget  you'll quickly realize that you are dispensing steamed water instead of steamed milk into your cup (plus  the cleaning sound is different than the frothy milk sound).cleaning the inside of the machine is an easy process (using vinegar) and the machine seems to stay much cleaner than the keurig machine i used to own.bottom line: so far  this machine has produced excellent results. takes a bit of effort but the results are worth it.
November 14 2019,5.0,43,impressive machine!,okay  so i just got this machine yesterday but so far i absolutely love it!!!i have been researching machines for weeks. and i have several saved but i wanted one now that wasn't super expensive. i also didn't want one that used pods because my last one did and putting the pod in was always hit or miss. the way the machine was set up the pod would drop down too far and not allow the panel to close  so i had to keep it held up with one finger inside the machine until the process was started. pain in the butt!!! plus  the espresso shots always came out too watery! so  this machine was on my saved list but it turned out to be the deal of the day yesterday  so i decided it was now or never and bought it. i also saved $50 since it was the deal of the day!!! yay!!!!!!!it was packed really well to protect from damage and i received it in perfect condition! the machine came with a scoop/tamper and a single and double shot interchangeable porta filter.first thing i did was read the instructions which were very clear and made set up super easy. i didn't realize that there were 2 separate pieces for the single shot and double shot espresso until i read the instructions either  so that was helpful. also  if you don't read the instructions  you might not realize that you have to move the steaming wand from the down position and aim it in the center of the cup. then you'd have a huge mess! it's a little hard to see the wand at first.i successfully made several kinds of drinks yesterday within 15 minutes of setting the machine up and plugging it in. i love when a company makes set up and instructions a breeze!!!things i love about this machine!!!first  it's very appealing to the eye. call me girly  i'm but i love the stainless panels and the lights around the buttons!there's a single and double for espresso shots  cappuccino's and latte's.if you hold the cappuccino button down for three seconds  it will bypass the cappuccino and just do milk and frothing only  which is perfect if you want to add vanilla chai tea mix but don't want a shot of espresso!!! by far my favorite feature!!!you can adjust the amount of froth with the knob on the front of the milk reservoir! genius!!! and it works really well!!! i'm talking gobs of froth for the froth lover!!!cleaning the frothing wand out is a breeze. you just adjust the frothing knob to the down position where it says clean. press and hold the latte button till it clicks and the pump starts then release the button and it runs hot water through so milk doesn't clog the wand!plus  the milk reservoir comes out and you can store it in the fridge so you don't have to dump the milk and waste it!!! again  genius!!!also  i only used bottled water on my last machine and i never had a problem with lime scale or hard water  so i will only use bottled water on this one as well.i also made some home made caramel whipped cream for a delicious topper!!!there's no grinder but that's not a big deal. i am using starbucks ground espresso roast and the result is a strong and perfect espresso shot!!! not watery like my last machine.*my advice  read the instructions. they will most likely teach you a few things you didn't realize you needed to know.so far i am super giddy over this machine!!!👍
October 28 2018,1.0,51,requires regular cleaning  died after 1.5 years,let me start off by saying  we drink lots of latte/cappuccino in our house  we go through them like tps. our first starter espresso machine krups xp1000 (less than 50 bucks) lasted us little over 2 years  our previous de'longhi ec155 (80 bucks) lasted us 2 years  and looks like this mr coffee ecmp1000 (mid one hundred bucks) died just after 1.5 years. sigh...... why don't things last these days. i keep thinking maybe the more expensive i go up the ladder  maybe they'll stop dying and last a bit longer.aside from using the deep cleaning feature everytime after we finished using it  we also regularly clean this thing by taking the frothing tubing portion of the module apart  because the frothing portion of the machine does clog up after about 20 cups  without cleaning the internal tubings  the ratio/portion of the milk would be off. the procedure isn't hard  you just have to remember how you take it apart so you can put it back together. unfortunately  after 1.5 years  seems like the internal pump that's dedicated to the frothing steam isn't working anymore. it stopped sucking up milk and sounds like the pump isn't priming anymore. i suspect it's dual pump setup with one for espresso  one for froth. the espresso portion of the pump still works  although sounds pretty rough too the last time we used it.we go through 4~5 cups a day  x 365 days and x 1.5 year = 2 737 cups mtbf (or mean "cup" before failure).this may be ok for the casual drinkers  but those who go through lattes heavily like we do  i recommend steer away and look elsewhere.when it worked  the ease and convenience is nice. you can pretty much set it to amount of froth you want  either latte or cappuccino  and just walk away  and come back in about a min and everything is done. only thing is you can't mix the sugar in with the froth before hand like a manual frothing machine could. you would just have to put the sugar in after everything is done and stir.for a steam based espresso machine  which tend to be cheap for beginners  i could be forgiving in their longevity  but for pump based machines  1.5 years is just ridiculous.on to the next. ..
August 6 2016,5.0,350,perfect budget espresso machine,i love this machine!  i've been using my mr. coffee cafe barista for 9 months and it's still going strong.  i mainly bought it because i was spending way to much getting coffee drinks like lattes and macchiatos at the coffeehouse.  my favorite feature is the fact that it steams and froths the milk at the same time.  you can also control the amount of froth that it makes which is an awesome feature.  i also have a mr. coffee burr grinder
April 4 2018,3.0,44,downgrading from 5 to 3 stsrs due to jarden warranty issues!!1,wow!  we are very particular about our coffee — we live in the puget sound and even if we have only one cup a day  it needs to be of consistent quality and delicious. so i just got this unit yesterday and completed the setup / primed the unit and gauged using the latte cycle plus added additional foam and voila!  we are both pegged on peet’s golden lattes right now  so i added a turmeric mix plus a half teaspoon of honey and 1/4 tsp of ginger  and the drink is already an 8 out of 10 plus a 10 for hotness. this drink was the perfect temp and just a bit hotter than how peet’s makes theirs. i hope the machine holds up and to help you all  i will continue to post updates thru the next several weeks. very easy to use and cleanup is a snap btw. can’t wait for my hubby to try. he was convinced we needed to spend 1500+ dollars to get a good espresso machine. coincidentally we also have their grinder —going on two years of use and still working fine.update 5/5/18:  very happy to say that we’ve now had our café barista for a few months and it is working great. we finally got the hang of how to make the perfect golden latte just like peet’s makes  and we are incredibly happy with the quality of the drinks and the money we are saving not going to a stand or to peet’s  anymore.  the value for the cost is highly recommended. who would have thought that for less than 200 dollars  we would have found a great little espresso maker.update 9/1/18 -- sorry to report that the milk frothing capability stopped working last month.  we have to g through parent company jarden who mfrs and warrants this product for the first year  and it[s been a sh@t show through and through.  submitted our claim 3 weeks ago  and we keep getting passed to another dept who requests info we already provided on the original claim  told the same troubleshooting steps and we still don't have a resolution.  for what we have spent going to a coffee stand due to this delay  we could have bought another espresso machine.  for this reason  i can no longer give this 5 stars.  buyer beware of jarden!!
March 8 2017,1.0,108,really sad about this purchase,really sad about this purchase  i wanted it to work and before i purchased  i did my homework and read all the reviews and decided to give it a chance.  at first  i was really pleased  but within a month on making one cappuccino a day the froth started getting big bubbles and became watery.  i had been running the clean cycle after every use and went through the whole vinegar cleansing thing and it still was making substandard froth.i contacted mr. coffee and they were great - sent out a new milk container w/ head and now a month has gone by and i am in the same boat again.i'm going to return it and spend a little more $ to get a better machine.  wish i had done that to begin with.
February 6 2018,1.0,45,do not waste your money on mr coffee products,i will never buy another mr coffee product again.  mr coffee does not stand behind their products.  after 1 year and 1  month our barista died  and the irony was that i purchased second cafe barista  for a friend 2 weeks before ours hit the bucket. the water will not shut off and it eventual turns to all lights flashing.  they only have a year warranty  and these machines cannot withstand every day use.  do not waste your money on mr coffee products  they are throw away machines.  i contacted mr coffee and they would do nothing to attempt to resolve our issues  while providing sub-par customer service. my warranty expired 25 days..... unless you want a one year machine  spend your money on another brand.
July 16 2017,5.0,43,great machine at a good price. would recommend.,i'm a former barista and i love this machine! i've worked at a quite a few local shops and one chain(not starbucks). i've worked on fully manual and semi-auto commercial espresso machines so i'm familiar with making drinks  proper maintenance  and minor repairs. five years ago i would have cringed at the thought of having an almost full-auto machine in my home. now that i've grown up quite a bit and have a normal  m-f 9 to 5 kind of job with a commute and all the fun stuff that comes with it  i'm willing to sacrifice my coffee morals for convenience but definitely not taste. i still grind my own beans because that's really the only way to do it in my opinion. i'n not saying it's the perfect machine but unless your willing to spend a lot more money on a "pro-sumer" machine(a professional grade machine but only has one head for brewing) then this is a great option. i recently got it on prime day when there was a lightning deal on it. i'd been looking into buying a new one that was more powerful than my old machine and this was a great fit. overall  if you're looking for a good machine to save some money on your morning coffee and save some time before your commute  this is a wonderful option.****note: please remember to properly clean and maintain the machine! run the cleaning cycle after every use. always  always  always use filtered water  never tap. there are too may minerals in tap and it will mess up your machine very quickly. be sure to descale your machine at the very least once a month depending on usage.  they sell excellent and easy to use descaling products on amazon as well.****pros:-it has a pump that's powerful enough to steam milk quickly and thoroughly and the machine doesn't overheat (i've had this issue before with different brand)-the water reservoir holds enough for several drinks. i didn't track it closely but i think i made about 8-10 drinks before running low on water-the milk reservoir holds enough milk to make two 15oz drinks and then some if you want a little extra-the controls are easy enough to use. one quick read through on the instructions and i was set-the machine has a cleaning setting for the steaming wand. it's still very important to go through and descale the machine and wash everything properly but that setting is really helpful if you know you'll be using it later in the day as well-i can fit a 16oz size coffee mug in it-you can adjust the amount of foam in your drink. so if you want a latte a little dry  you can definitely get that.neutral:-volume. i wouldn't say it's a loud machine by any stretch  but it's not exactly quiet when steaming milk. but if you've ever used an espresso machine or been around one  you know that's not the quiet part of making a drink anyways-the filter basket in the porta-filter twist locks into place. not really an issue but it can get a little annoying when it spins as you're trying to tamp espressocons:-if your only goal is to get beautiful  coffee shop style latte art  this is not the machine for you. it's practical  not artsy. it makes a darn good latte or cappuccino but it doesn't get frilly. i knew what i was getting so that wasn't an issue for me at all.-i can't fit a tall  travel tumbler in it- if you want a "no-foam" latte  you won't be getting that. the machine always produces foam. this is not an issue for me but i realize it may be for some people. it's easy enough to just scoop the foam off the top. in reality  anytime you steam milk your're going to get foam. whenever you order a "no-foam" latte at a coffee shop  the foam is still there the barista just has to use a spoon to hold the foam back from pouring into your cup.
October 8 2020,1.0,13,good machine  bad customer service.,i have had this machine about a month  and it was working fine  and still does  but the entire reason i bought this was for the latte feature. well it seems as though someone in my household threw away the "suction straw" of the froth reservoir and i messaged mr. coffee on the company website and i keep getting this automated generated message. i looked on their website for the part  it's not listed at all  i try to buy the assembly for the froth reservoir  there's no part listed. all this for a freakin straw  so that the milk comes out and pours into the cup. don't worry mr. coffee i bought a "frother" and will still use the espresso feature but i plan on getting rid of it  because i wanted a one stop shop machine. oh well.....
November 24 2017,1.0,37,mr.coffee poor quality product,this machine started malfunctioning after one month of normal use. the frothing milk function ceased working completely. we returned the machine and received a replacement one  but the same problem (exactly the same problem) occurred again in about one month. we've been extremely carefull and always followed the manufacturers instructions so there's no reason for this to happen except for the poor quality of the product.it was also very unpleasant knowing that mr.coffee brand considers that when a product is sent to other countries except the us and canada the warranty period is automatically void. all this was a very bad experience. don't buy this product.rui barrosoportugal
May 7 2019,5.0,16,love it,other than 1. some priming issues prior to first use and 2. my impatience waiting for it to heat up for a couple minutes prior to use and 3. it not fitting my favorite (very tall) cupsi love this machine!-it's attractive and takes up less space than a traditional coffee maker-easy to use-froths plant-based milks: soy  almond  coconut  flax  hemp  etc. very well!- makes coffee shop quality drinks very cheaply-better than keurig bc no k-cups and fancier drink optionstips- i keep a compost pail next to it to smack the grinds into after making a cup. don't let the grinds sit or they will harden into a brick. coffee grinds are great for composting or can be added directly to garden/planter soil for a nutrient boost-turn it on before you start preparing the coffee and milk to minimize your wait time- store milk compartment in refrigerator between uses-use straw width pipe cleaner to hand clean milk compartment tubes as needed- use well filtered water to prevent mineral build-up
April 21 2018,1.0,43,not suggested,we purchased this machine on june of 2016. we loved it! unfortunately about a year later the frother stopped working properly. we contacted mr. coffee and were told that the frother had an internal issue. when i asked what we should do they said buy a new machine. i asked if less than 2 years was the typical life expectancy of this machine and they said no they are designed to last much longer. however we are out of warranty so we are out of luck. such a bummer. i’d suggest a different brand.
May 8 2021,2.0,9,great  until it wasn’t…,i’ve had this espresso machine for about 2 years. it was exactly what i needed  and at a price that was comparable to a good coffee maker. makes a decent foam and espresso is easy to use and clean  plus it’s all automatic!however  now the milk frothing portion has failed tremendously. you can hear the pump trying to suck in milk and mix with hot air  but it can’t really do it. nothing is clogged that i can see  and it was cleaned regularly. it can usually get a little out at the end  but right as it times out. pretty disappointed with its longevity.
October 21 2018,1.0,16,i so wanted to like this but,a very short lived love affair.i’ve only had it for a total of two days.as soon as i got this machine it was setup and cleaned as instructed. i’ve made several cups of latte and cappuccino for my family and they were all delicious. i would go as far to say they tasted professional. however. that pleasure was short lived. the pump went out this morning. two days after i received this machine the pump goes out. seriously...... ???  yeah  i disassembled and cleaned it. looked up several troubleshooting tips but nothing worked. took the filter out and simply ran water through it and all we get is dribbles of water.my advice. until they make this unit more reliable.... buy something else.i don’t want another one. i just want to return this one.sad
January 14 2021,5.0,6,in love since 2017,i've had him since january of 2017. this machine has brought me and my guest alot of delight. the motor has just started to slow after 3 years but as much use as i have gotten out of it  i can't blame it on the product. i've only had to replace one part  the milk container  which i melted by accident. i ordered directly from mr. coffee website. i'd misplaced the rubber straw a few times and found i could substitute a hard smoothie straw  not plastic  in it's place. i've seen some people complain that it doesn't work after a few uses and i'd like to stress the following:1. make sure you read the instructions and clean the milk steamer and stream often.2.clean the machine at least every 6 months by flushing with  water and vinegar through the system. it takes me about 15 processes before it's clean and no more vinegar taste in the reservoir.3. only use espresso grains as it will not work if you try to use anything else in the cups.4. after a few yrs  the milk frother sputters and stalls and the espresso release is slower  i just add more milk froth by pressing the latte function and stop it when i have enough milk and for the espresso  if it does not pump out the first time  i just put it on the espresso function alone  and that gets the job done.overall  this is my favorite appliance  and i have many  and i would not hesitate to purchase another. compared to the prices of the other brands  i'm beyond happy with my choice and if i chose to replace it  it would still be far less than having purchased one of the more high end brands.❤️
February 20 2018,1.0,24,lasted 15 months,i really loved this coffee maker  until suddenly it quit. was having a bad day  finally shoved the worries aside  saying i’ll just have a cup of coffe and then i’ll think about it.well the machine dribbled out a teaspoon of espresso and stopped.  i washed everything carefully  tried again. made a lot of noise  got very hot  nothing. tried resetting it: turned it off   unplugged it let it sit. again  lots of storm and fury  no coffee.nothing left to do but cry
September 23 2020,5.0,6,still good in 9/2020?? yes!,just picked up the mr. coffee espresso and cappuccino maker.  read all the reviews  most good  some not so good.  watched a youtube vid of someone comparing an espresso made from a $3000 machine vs a $150 machine.  the person(who sells the $3000 machine) had a really hard time telling the difference.  that sold me that the machine doesn't really matter too much...it's the grind of the coffee and the beans themselves.  this machine is the bomb.  if you like coffee...this is for you.  dead simple to use  simple to clean.  watch the many youtube videos on it..and yes  it is still great today  just as it was years ago when it came out.  is there better machines out there?  of course  but if you want one that is proven to work over time  get this one.  i would recommend getting a good tamper...the plastic one that comes with it is pretty flimsy.  go for it.  you won't regret it.  promise.
November 14 2020,3.0,5,decent machine depending on what you're looking for.,i bought this machine with intentions of having it replace my almost daily morning latte's i get from peet's. i'm a bit of a coffee snob which is why this machine gets a lower rating  not because it's a bad machine or is bad at what it's supposed to do. the quality of the coffee depends on the consumers expectations. i wanted to replicate what i get from the coffee shop which if its a latte then this device isn't capable. part of that is how the latte is made. when you order it from the cafe they brew the espresso  then add flavoring syrup if you wanted it  then they froth the milk and pour it over the espresso and flavoring. this machine by default doesn't do it that way. if you press the latte buttons it will heat and add the milk to the glass then froth the milk and put it on top and then brew and put the espresso overtop of all of that  you then would either add the flavoring after or before all of that happened. the foam because this is an automated device  doesn't mater which setting you use for the foam the best you'll get is medium/small bubbles that are dry like a cappuccino.i attempted to rectify the reverse nature of how the machine makes a latte by choosing the espresso buttons and then manually adding the milk froth after  however the results were very similar because again the frother isn't capable of making micro bubble in the milk which is required for a latte.summary: if you're looking for a step up from a fully automatic machine like a k-cup machine where you can control the amount of coffee more  or you want the same thing a k-cup will give you but without all the expensive k-cups and waste that k-cup machines produce  then this is the machine for you! if you want coffee shop quality latte's then this isn't for you. you need a fully manual espresso maker where you froth the milk with a steam wand (i bought one  and its not as easy as it looks to make a decent coffee; plus you need extra stuff like a scale  and a good tamp and coffee distribution tool  and a timer to make good lattes. depending on what you buy you might need a few other things too.)
April 16 2018,5.0,12,a great intro to the world of espresso-based drinks,i'm new to the world of coffee  but already found i prefer espresso-based drinks over those brewed in a drip-style or pod-type machine. what to do  then  if you want to take baby steps towards brewing at home? for me  this machine was a no brainer. at the time  it was only about $150 (although that price has apparently fluctuated since)  making it a relatively inexpensive way to try different drinks at home.simply put  i adore this machine. my wife  a more established coffee drinker  also loves what this machine is capable of. with fresh milk and high-quality/ fresh coffee grounds  it's hard to taste much difference between what we're able to brew at home and what we can order from a quality coffee shop.my only couple complaints i have with this machine are:1. there are settings to auto-brew cappuccinos and lattes based off a double shot of espresso  but they also increase the total volume of the drink considerably - to the point where only a few of our coffee mugs can handle the volume. i instead auto-brew a double shot of espresso  then manually produce the steamed/ foamed milk into a pitcher (you can do so by manually holding the cappuccino button for 3+ seconds)  and then pour into the drink.2. i find the warm-up time to be slightly on the long side. i've countered this by plugging the machine into a wi-fi connected outlet  which i can activate by google assistant in one side of the house  giving it a couple of minutes to come to temperature before i enter the kitchen.there are a few things you should seriously consider adding to your purchase list if you're considering this machine:1. a high-quality 49-mm tamper. yes  the plastic scoop that comes with this machine can technically double as a tamper  but after picking up a proper weighted tamper -- even the $10 budget one on amazon - it's so much easier to pack the portafilter with coffee in order to get a proper brew.2. one or two stainless steel frothing pitchers. especially important if you plan on brewing a drink to fill a tall to-go style tumbler  as it will not likely fit beneath the machine.3. a proper knock box for coffee grounds that you can keep on your countertop by the machine.while yes  a much more expensive  more professional-grade machine may be more
March 26 2018,4.0,12,does what i want it to do,first off  i am glad i got this when i did in red as the price went way up now. so watch those price fluctuations.i have had it for about 2 weeks now and used all the options on it. i can't speak to how it will hold up long term as its much to early for that.i did get another tamper as some have suggested and it works better for me. but i think the one that comes with it can also work. i just needed something to grab onto better.i was looking around and comparing machines. i ended up getting this mr. coffee for a couple of reasons. i cannot afford an expensive espresso machine and in the entry level market  i think they are all about the same with the 15 bar pumps. so i was looking at those with steamwands and this one. i wanted a machine i can make cappuccinos with and maybe lattes and cortados.the reason i settled on this one instead of one with a wand is the amount of milk used. i am the only one that makes milk based drinks and with a wand  one has to put a certain amount in a separate container and that milk is then used up. with this machine  it only dispenses what you need. so if i make a small cappuccino or a cortado  it uses not very much milk. and the rest of the milk stays fresh and untouched and goes back in the fridge. its less wasteful for my uses i believe. for a cortado for example  i make so little milk that it would not work with a wand. you have to put in to a certain level on those.its also nice not having to fiddle with a wand and just pressing a button and it does it all for you.i have a good grinder already as i also use other methods of making coffee still. aeropress  pourover  etc. i got this for making milk drinks mostly. so i use fresh whole beans for this just like i do for my other methods. my husband likes the bustelo i got so i could get the espresso grind just right on my grinder.when i first got it i did the priming which too 3 tries. then i did the vinegar cleanse as i saw one reviewer describe. can't hurt to get all the factory oils and grime out of the pipes in any case. after that i played with the weight and grind. i always weigh my beans and i can fit 7 grams in the small holder and 14 grams in the large. that works out best for me. i had a few were i either tamped too hard or had a too fine grind and nothing came out. just stop the machine and go courser or don't tamp so hard.you can either let the machine do it all with one button press  or you can make a espresso first  do the manual milk in a separate container and then pour it over the espresso. i do that when i make cortados. that way you can swirl the milk and have less bubbles in it. so you can easily make froth to put on top of hot chocolate. i made some to put in my pero drink  which is a grain based non coffee drink.besides the presets there are manual options for the espresso  so if you want you can hold the button down and it puts up to 5 ounce of extra on the shot. i suppose to can hit it twice and make a larger cup. but i prefer to make americanos. make the espresso and then pour hot water over it from the kettle. it does work though holding the espresso button if that is what you prefer to get the hot water that way. the other manual button is the froth  which you also activate by holding the button for 3 seconds. just be careful to watch that as it just keeps coming out for like 30 seconds. i walked away the first time and my big mug overflowed like crazy. just hit the button again to make it stop.so its pretty flexible outside of the presets.it cleans quite easy. i always run a cleaning cycle through the milk wand. it takes 30 seconds and at the same time i clean the portafilter. that is pretty much it. wipe the wand and put the milk container back in the fridge.and from time to time i run a empty portafilter to clean out the grinds from underneath and wipe around a bit.it does what i wanted it to do. i still have my pour over coffees or my aeropress  but i like to have a couple of milk based drinks during the day. when i get really fancy i put some syrups in it. i like the sugar free monin ones for that.i also got me a knockbox for all the grinds. i don't really want to smack it on my garbage can and i don't want to put them in the sink. works great.
August 10 2021,4.0,5,tons of foam  otherwise great,my husband got this for me for our anniversary and i love it! my only issue has been that even on the lowest foam setting (with the dial turned as far left as it will go on the “latte” setting)  it still makes a ton of foam. this is the (theoretically) 12 ounce latte in a 16 ounce mug. the foam takes up a third of the cup. i always scoop it out into the sink because i don’t like that much foam  which is a bit annoying. other than that  this machine is great! we upgraded from a cheap sowtech espresso machine (the kind that makes shots in a carafe) and the espresso this makes tastes much smoother. i love how easy the automated settings are. i used my old machine mostly for iced coffee  but i’ve been drinking a lot of hot lattes with this because they’re so good! my husband isn’t a coffee person  but even he wants one on all his days off. it makes white chocolate raspberry lattes comparable to my favorite coffee shop in college. definitely recommend—just use a bigger cup than the manual says and be prepared to scoop out all that unnecessary foam.
October 26 2018,1.0,11,machines keep breaking  and jarden keeps taking their time making it right,we bought this back in february  and it was terrific for about the first six months. it made some of the best coffee either my wife or i ever had  the foaming function worked really well. if not for the following  we'd give it four or five stars.but.in september  it stopped working properly. one of the neat things about it is that it will automatically brew one or two shots of espresso  as well as as much as you want  up to about a full 8 oz. cup. well  it is neat until that's the only thing it will do  regardless of whether you pick one or two shots. it made a lot of messes  and it was still under warranty  so we called mr. coffee (jarden customer service)  and they said all they needed was a proof of purchase and they'd send us a new one  no problem. they didn't even want the old one back.except it was a problem. i called them a few days after we sent them the amazon invoice  they said they never received it. so we sent it again. and again. each time  we asked them to include some kind of acknowledgement that they received the email  and we heard nothing. finally  i wrote them a fourth email nearly a month after we'd originally sent the invoice telling them that we'd sent the invoice to them several times and had heard nothing from them  and we needed to know what was going on. it was about this time they responded to our first email--the one they said they never got--and said that the replacement was on its way.we got that one early this month (october)  and it worked well--until a couple of days ago; now it simply will not turn on at all. so  call jarden customer service again.now  they want us to ship the now-defective replacement with a shipping label that will be emailed to me...in 3-5 weeks  because of the system they use (for what it's worth  the woman i talked to seemed to sympathize with me on how ridiculous this system is). once i get that label around thanksgiving  i should call them after 24 hours after we ship it so they can put it into their system. then  presumably  they'll start the process of shipping us a replacement machine that will no doubt arrive around april fool's day  because why not  and will operate  if the trend holds  for approximately 27:45.i'll consider revising my review depending on how they resolve this  but right now the fact of the matter is that product doesn't last  and mr. coffee / jarden is completely indifferent to taking care of their customers. this machine is expensive enough as it is  and if you have the opportunity to buy another 15-bar pressurized espresso machine from a reputable manufacturer  take it. you'll actually be able to use it for a while.
August 17 2019,4.0,7,good machine with livable inconsistencies,first  i am amazed that people give this 1 star if it breaks after 1. 5 years of use  making 4-5 espresso shots per day  365 days a year. unless you are purchasing a commercial grade machine for $1000  i don't think anyone can expect more than 2000 shots of espresso from any machine. even if only making espresso  you'd save $0.50 per shot at home.... 2000 x $0.50 = $1000 savings.  does that really equal 1 star??ownership time: we've owned this for 6 months so far.  probably made 150+ large cappuccinos (double shots) during that time.quality of taste: this machine is consistent with taste and has a good quality flavor (lavazza espresso is amazing).  i wish it didn't mix as much water with the espresso as it does at times.  sometimes i'll use a double shot of espresso while selecting a single shot on the machine  but most times i'll make it with default machine settings.temperature inconsistency: if this machine is left on for 10 minutes before making a drink  it will be extremely hot. you will burn your mouth.  because of this  we only turn it on when ready to make a drink. we learned this by burning our mouths.  this inconsistency is the reason i give it only 4 stars.volume inconsistency: we noticed that if the machine is on for a while  the cup size changes. i don't know if this is related to the temperature inconsistency or not. once we learned to turn it on right before making a drink  the cup size became more consistent.clean up: this is very easy to clean up. the milk reservoir is nice when making drinks everyday.machine noise: this is a noisy machine  although i have never known a cappuccino machine to be quiet. if you are expecting it to be as quiet as a keurig  you'll be disappointed.9/20/20 update:still going strong.  as a matter of fact  with all the working from home from the pandemic  we've probably made another 300 large cappuccinos in the last year.  i would say the machine has made 500+ large cappuccinos (double shots) since we've owned it. from this  we probably have saved $1500 versus going to starbucks (which is not good compared to cappuccinos made with lavazza).
August 27 2018,2.0,11,we like how easy it is to use the machine  but mr. coffee support is a disappointment.,purchased for an anniversary gift for my wife.  she likes the machine a lot  largely because it is very easy to use and the espresso drinks taste fine.  the removable milk container is great as it can just go in and out of the refrigerator as needed.  after a month of use  the little plastic clip broke on the filter assembly.  it isn't a critical piece  so the machine functions fine.  however  contacting mr. coffee to see if it would be covered under warranty was an exercise in futility.  submit email.  get an automated reply with a reference number.  never hear back.  repeat.  i tried chatting  but it must have been too close to closing time  because they kept cancelling out my chat sessions until live chat was closed for the day.  fortunately  i have a square trade warranty on the machine so if anything else breaks i will be able to go through them.  it's a good starter machine and worth it at the $99-$150 price point  but not for any higher price than that.  (they have a new version selling at $329... yikes.) i won't buy a mr. coffee again if their support can't respond to a simple question  so when this one dies we will no doubt upgrade to a better brand.
February 2 2018,3.0,12,updated: didn't last long enough to justify the price,update: after a little over 2 years with this machine  it's in dire need of replacement  and probably needed to be replaced months ago if i'm complete honest.  the milk barely comes out anymore  let alone froths  even after repeated attempts to clean the interior of the machine with vinegar per the instructions.  i was so good about always using the clean cycle after every use  too  so there's no reason for this.  when the problem first started cropping up  cleaning it with vinegar worked  but not anymore.  i think i'm going to get a machine with an exterior milk frother (and for cheaper  too!) to avoid this problem in the future.i bought this coffee machine after a tip from a friend  a tour of how it works  and a lot of additional research  so i knew i was going to like it.  it's easy to use  way cheaper to run than my nespresso machine since i can buy regular coffee instead of pods  and it's easier to clean too  between the clean cycle on the milk reservoir and the milk reservoir being dishwasher safe.  i do have to say i prefer to do custom amounts of milk  since if i use the latte button  the first one always overflows the cup with foam no matter what i do  perhaps from water in the system after the clean cycle the day before?  but this is a small issue and not a problem at all.i love this machine so much  and have used it nearly every day since buying it months ago  so i was devastated this past weekend when i accidentally broke the retainer clip on my porta-filter (the thing with the handle -- the clip holds the filter in when you dump out the used coffee grounds).  i checked the product documentation and figured out it was still under a one-year warranty  so i contacted mr. coffee and told them what had happened.  they immediately sent out a replacement.  no questions asked!  and i received it today  a friday  only five days after i emailed them sunday night.  wow!with that kind of warranty and customer support  there's really no reason not to buy this amazing machine!
June 11 2020,1.0,6,you never know how much coffee you get,i have this machine for a few months now. and i’ve never got the same amount of coffee with same setup of settings and milk. i follow all the installation and maintenance guidelines  but sadly you never know how much coffee the machine will make you in the end. you can select small cup and get it overfilled (like on the picture attached)  or half of that cup when you select large setting. same with foam. other than that  the machine is fine lol. but it’s so difficult to clean the parts after it’s spilled all over the place... or so frustrating to get a small cup when you wanted large. just a heads up guys.
June 7 2017,5.0,16,a tip for those who like a frothy cup of cappuccino or latte,this espresso machine is amazing for the price. it's compact  pretty sturdy for its size and it looks good in the kitchen. i've experimented with this machine in the last few weeks and i've liked it more and more with each passing day. here's a tip for those of you who like a frothy cup of cappuccino. make sure your milk is at room temperature and is not straight from the fridge cold. this machine does not come with a frothing wand so you can't warm the milk up that way and get it to froth. the little milk chute froths the milk and pumps it directly into your cup of coffee. if your milk is cold  the milk chute does not have enough power or heat to froth the milk. what i do is take my milk out from the fridge and heat a little up in a small pan over the stove to get it a little warm and then i pour it into the coffee machine's milk dispenser. this helps it froth up better and the machine sends a perfect stream of hot frothy milk into the waiting cup. sure it takes a little more time but why rush when you're making yourself a great cup of coffee to start the day :)
June 18 2016,5.0,21,rip mr. coffee. 1 689 days old. we'll miss you!,wife makes a cup a day for the last six months. no issues so far. she runs the cleaning cycle every time she uses the frother. we have not run any cleaning solutions through the water  and we have not noticed any decrease in performance.the frother bugs me a bit when i make hot chocolate  but if i stir the milk in my cup as it's being poured  it seems to cut down on the frothiness of it.*update*running strong for over a year now! i should probably clean it sometime... haven't noticed any decrease in performance yet due to not cleaning.*another update*we ordered this on december 5  2015. today is september 27  2017. why the update? the frother stopped working on latte mode!i first cracked open the milk dispenser top to see if there was a clog. turns out  it's super simple in there  and not much to clean. i paged through the manual  and there's a section in there about cleaning. hey  wouldn't you know  mr. coffee says to run vinegar through the thing once every forty-eighty cups to delime it! my wife has been pretty regular in her coffee habit  minus missing a few days  plus making a few cups for guests  so i would estimate we're about 660 cups in so far! just a little bit over the eighty cups they recommend a cleaning at for those of us with hard water.anyway  i (sorta) followed the deliming instructions  ran a half gallon of vinegar through it using both the espresso and cleaning cycles  and the latte setting on the frother works again.and for those of you who are wary... this thing works great! my wife isn't a coffee snob  but this machine is helping her to become one. she's (mostly) sworn off that overpriced star place's coffee  as she's come to find it's very bitter  unless there's a pound of sugar in it  then it's too sweet. while the mr. coffee cafe barista doesn't have all sorts of fancy features as you may see in more expensive models  this bad boy reliably delivers what it promises  and can save you tons of money! just think... we've spent maybe $100 on espresso pre-ground coffee  $300 on cocoa (it's good cocoa) & syrups. compare that with the  at very least  $4/cup  and we're looking at $540 for 660 cups with the mr. coffee  compared to $2 640+ for coffee from that star place. pretty good deal!*final update - rip mr.coffee*we orderes this on december 5  2015. it finally stopped making espresso on july 19  2020. that's 1 689 days of coffee. we didn't make coffee every day  so let's say one cup every three days. over the years we've ordered 39 1lb bags of fancy imported italian espresso ground coffee  at about $7/lb  spent maybe $100 on flavorings/cocoa  let's guess $300 on milk/creamer (though probably way less)  and add $10 on vinegar for cleanings. that puts us up around $700 for ingredients  plus the cost of the unit (let's say $200  but it's less).so! if we say an espresso is brewed every three days  that's 563 uses (mostly double shots). if we assume the average bucks coffees are $4  that would be $2 252 spent at the bucks for burned coffee loaded with sugar. compare that with with the $883 on making coffee at home. divide that by the 563 cups we made  and that's $1.57 per drink! that's a savings of $2.43 per drink!so if you're wary about spending so much money on buying this thing  or just can't afford such a large purchase in one go  i would urge you to save up for this purchase. it's easy to use  mostly automatic  not too much of a pain to clean (buy some little pipe cleaners! makes life easier)  and saves you a ton of money compared to buying coffee from a barista. granted it's not as convenient  but would you rather make your espresso a day in advance so it has a chance to chill in the fridge before you make your 64oz gut buster iced mocha  or would your prefer spending an extra $3 ever work day to spend ten minutes in the drive through?
June 19 2021,4.0,3,saves so much money!,i've had this machine for 4 years now & it's still working! i use distilled water in it 99% of the time! because of the distilled water i never have to run a special latte machine cleaner thru it or vinegar water mixture. i also believe it has lasted longer & in better condition because i've used the distilled water. i also put about a half inch of milk in the milk holder & freeze over night then add the rest of milk as soon as i get up. making my latte with cold cold milk makes great foam! i also agree w/ other reviews saying 1-2% milk works best! i use lavazza crema gusto classic ground espresso & monin caramel syrup! it's perfect! i used to be addicted to dunkin donuts lattes & now i won't buy because i've aquired a taste for latte made this way & only this way! saves so much money!
March 20 2016,5.0,89,great machine for the price.,great machine for the price. i spent a good amount of time researching for an espresso and latte machine. i looked over different brands and costs and while i agree this is not a expensive or professional machine  it does make great espressos and lattes. very easy to use and clean and definitely love the taste. my daughter loves the hot chocolate with frothed milk and even my wife likes her cappuccinos. i read a few reviews regarding water leaks and i can't see this to be a problem  it's more on if the water tank is inserted properly. i also have a kerrigan machine and they both are almost the same size. one more thing  the machine starts and warms water faster (no more than a 5-7 minutes). definitely a great buy so far. if you are looking for a decent price and great coffee maker this is the one for you.
July 14 2017,5.0,20,scientific review of cafe barista's liquid volume output,i just purchased the café barista and it makes great espresso and cappuccino. i can't comment on the quality of the latte because i don't drink latte and so i cannot judge. i developed a taste for expresso and cappuccino on my visits to italy and more often than not i am disappointed when ordering these drinks at major coffee chains here in the states  hence why i brew my own. for years i have used manual machines and been happy with the results  however  as i get older i am getting lazier so wanted more automation - hence purchasing the cafa barista.before purchasing this product i did my research (i am retired  but once was a research director at a not-for-profit research institute). the only concern i had was that some reviewers said the volume of the liquid delivered could be low compared to what was listed in the users manual. upon first using the machine i thought so too. so being the geek i am i decided to conduct some experiments. i ran 10 trials under different conditions and used accurate measuring devices to measure the liquid delivered. bottom line if you don't want to read the details is this a great little machine but not perfect - but for the price it is an amazing feat of engineering.what i found is that the unit consistently delivers 1.75 ozs for a single shot expresso  and 3.5 ozs for a double shot expresso. more than the advertised 1.25 and 2.5 ozs -- so no complaint there. next i measured cappuccino output. the output delivered will vary based on the temperature and fill level of the milk reservoir. a full reservoir at room temperature will consistently deliver a 5.5 oz single cappuccino  and a 9 oz double cappuccino. a little less than advertised. if you let the reservoir get low you will see a reduction in liquid by about 1/4 oz. if you heat the milk before putting it in the reservoir you will lose another 1/4 oz of output. hot milk is losing volume in the steaming frothing process so this makes complete sense.single latte output ranges from 7-9 ozs depending on fill level of the reservoir and temperature of the milk. for double lattes output ranges from 11-12 ozs. this is significantly below what is advertised.in my opinion  for the price you pay for this device this performance is excellent. and the bottom line is the taste and for my palate the espresso and cappuccino out of this machine is better than what i can do with my manual machine  and is better than 99% percent of the product sold in cafes here in the states. there is one little family run café here in the states that i visit occasionally  run be a couple of italian ex-pats  that the café barista can't best - but that is the only one.
February 2 2019,1.0,6,does anyone work at mr. coffee? answer the phone  please!,for 5 months we enjoyed 2-3 cappuccinos every weekday morning and 4-5 on the weekends. babied it every day. rinsed the portafilter and wiped the machine attachment between each cup. took apart the portafilter and handwashed after last cup each morning. flushed the milk spicot after the last cappuccino every morning (super easy). hand washed the milk reservoir and all parts (took it all apart) every other day once we used all the milk up (otherwise it stores in the fridge. so convenient.). we had fun grinding our own coffee and experimenting with different coffee brands and roasts. it was one of the best anniversary presents ever. until it wasn’t. one day in october (5 months of use) it just stopped frothing milk. the milk spat out of the tube a bit at a time and steam built up inside the milk reservoir. obviously something had broken—a seal or seam. it has a year's warranty and my husband bought the 3-year extension  so we weren’t too worried. we tried various fixes over the next several weeks—vineagar cleaning  water cleaning  extra cleaning of the milk reservoir  etc. without any relief. my husband started attempting to contact mr. coffee on black friday 2018. now he is a busy attorney and i am a busy surgeon  so we haven’t been sitting on the phone or on the computer attempting an online chat every minute since the end of november. however  i was very much enjoying my daily cappuccinos and this task was assigned to him  so you can imagine he has been “reminded” on frequent occasion that the machine is still out of order 😉. at this point he has yet to reach a person at mr. coffee. out of frustration (and it takes a lot for him to reach that point) he tried implementing our extended 3-year warranty  but they don’t take over until the 1 year (at this point worthless) warranty with mr. coffee ends. it has been over 3 months since our mr. coffee machine manufactured a delicious cappuccino to start my busy day. i finally convinced my husband to order another milk resorvoir on our own dime and deal with mr. coffee financially later. it was to be delivered yesterday  from mr. coffee  but didn’t arrive. insult to injury  that is. my husband is convinced the milk reservoir won’t fix the problem and we need a whole new machine. maybe so. either way  it looks like we will need to rely on our 3-year extended warranty to kick in in may to sort all of this out. sad  really. enjoyed the machine immensely while it worked. if someone would just answer the phone at mr. coffee  i’m sure we could sort this all out.
January 10 2018,3.0,15,the machine's sensors are sensitive. it takes practice getting ...,the machine's sensors are sensitive. it takes practice getting this machine right. my tips:1. don't forget to run the vinegar deep clean as mentioned by a previous user. (the manual doesn't say to do this in the initial setup but drinking a cup full of bitter chemicals doesn't taste good)2. the espresso light keeps blinking  make sure it is locked all the way3. if all 3 lights keep blinking  the milk container is not in correctly. you must line up the whole "just so" for the sensors to read the container is in place correctly. it usually takes me 3-8 tries to figure out the "just so" position
April 26 2021,5.0,2,great espresso machine for the price w/a 1 year warranty,i love this espresso machine and enjoy mr. coffee's customer service even more! i am giving this review 5 stars due to the fact that mr. coffee was able to easily replace my malfunctioning machine.we love making all sorts of espresso  from iced americanos and lattes to hot cappuccinos and plain doppios. we debated on getting a nespresso  but did not like the coffee pod options and loathe keurig products since the coffee is not strong enough. the single or double shot option with this espresso machine is great  and you can really pack as much ground beans as you want. the cleaning process is easy  and i recommend cleaning the frother with a straw cleaner each time you use dairy products  along with the espresso machine's "cleaning" feature.i looked into different espresso machines listed for under $200 and decided on this one. i was expecting it to last a year or so (of running smoothly) with working from home and figured that purchasing this café barista would save me a lot of money. i drink white chocolate americanos and  with tip  that costs about $4-$5 per day. this machine ran smoothly for about 8 months before the frother gave out and would not produce froth/water. that being said  my sister and her family lives next door and she comes over to make two cappuccinos during the week on top of our household's two americanos. plus whenever we want decaf coffee at night  that's about 4-6 uses per week day and at least 2 uses per day during the weekend (unless my niece wants an iced coffee).i tried what i could to get the frother to work again to no avail. this wasn't too bad since i normally drink americanos and the espresso shots were still working smoothly  but my sister and niece like frothed milk and i wanted to get the full use out of the machine. contacting mr. coffee to replace the machine under warranty was quick and easy. they asked what was wrong  sent tips and an option to replace the machine. i was asked to send pictures of the serial numbers  the machine  and ship it back (shipping paid by mr. coffee)  and was sent a new machine.
March 7 2018,1.0,25,machine part change - only ese pods now,negative stars if possible. mr. coffee has changed their product to now come with a "premium" ese pod holder and no filterz. i contacted customer service and they offer to do you the favor of allowing you to buy (for an additional $20 after shipping) the 1 and 2 shot filters. don't worry though  you will also need a different porta-head to hold those filters and that will only run you an additional $20 after shipping.aren't they ever so nice? now you are out a ridiculous amount for the machine and if you ever wish to use your own coffee with it you can either spend the amount an entire expresso machine costs for the parts or buy a pod maker and individual filters to diy your pods adding 20 minutes and a nice mess to your morning routine.
January 7 2022,3.0,1,decent taste  easy to use  but ultimately returned,for first time espresso machine users  we thought this was super easy to use and the espresso tasted decent enough. we invested in a machine to curb spending money at coffee shops - and it worked! we used this machine for about a month before ultimately deciding to return. we initially liked that everything was automatic - but this ended up being the downfall. the milk frother worked but was exceptionally inconsistent. sometimes you’d get an unbelievable amount of froth to the point it overflowed the cup and sometimes it hardly used any at all - regardless of how much you adjusted the frothing knob. therefore  you always ended up wasting milk because you never knew how much it was going to use. using multiple times a day  you end up wasting a lot. cleaning the tubes on the frothing portion was also difficult and something you wouldn’t have to worry about with a manual frother. we used a ninja specialty coffee maker (not even a real espresso machine) one time and were amazed at how easy it is to warm/froth the milk yourself and how much more control it gives you over portions. we thought it tasted better too! the mr. coffee will do the job… but in our opinion  you can do better for less money.
October 3 2020,2.0,2,you can't get parts - don't buy this unless you want to replace it every 12  18 or 24 months,overall this was a reasonably inexpensive fully automatic espresso  cappuccino maker and it worked reasonably well.  never great  but good enough.the problem is that the maker - mr coffee has apparently decided to not make many of the replacement parts that you are likely to need after as soon as 12 to 24 months of use.the key parts they don't offer that you will need are the pressure filter baskets  which include hard and flexible plastic parts that will wear out or break and the filter holder (the part with the handle).the original filter basket has detents in the sides that help hold it in the holder/handle and the original filter holder / handle has a plastic flip-over basket holder.  these two aspects help hold the filter in when you knock out the used grounds.  without them you will end up most likely having to dig out the grounds with a spoon....you can buy replacement parts that will work  but they don't have the retention design aspects described above.this may not sound like such a big deal  but if you use this on a daily basis  this is a messy pain.  and you have to deal with it after every use.i am very disappointed that mr coffee does not support this product with replacement parts  especially when they are continuing to sell the product.  that is just bad  screw the customer business practice.i won't be buying any mr coffee products in the future.  i will eventually invest in a breville or other product by a vendor committed to their products and customers for the long-run.  yes  they are more expensive  but $180 a pop for one of these every 18 months can get you into breville price territory before you know it.  i don't like throw-away products / companies  especially over lack of availability of $20-$30 worth of parts.
January 15 2020,1.0,3,not worth the pricepoint,i bought this as a christmas gift to myself and was excited to stop spending the money at starbucks. upon arrival  i prepped the machine as stated per instructions. upon first use i could already tell there was a problem; frother barely worked and when using the double shot  my coffee mugs (standard size) where only being filled halfway. this machine is supposed to make 12oz or more on double shot. i tested it out for a week to see if the hoses just needed to be warmed up a bit. no use. contacted customer support (they are great) and had a replacement at my doorstep the next day.2nd machine  frother works like a charm! however  a week later and the flow of the espresso is next to none. the machine just cant handle what its built for with its plastic parts. the espresso cup is hard to attach to the machine  you have to hold the whole thing in order to twist it in to place.while i dont mind maintained and upkeep for the machine (honestly  you're working with milk and water  its going to get moldy so you need to clean when you're done  don't be gross) the price point of this should be less than $100.all in all  a very problematic machine that doesnt last  all parts of mostly made of plastic which will melt with time  and the frother has been known to stop/malfunction. i would suggest getting a simple espresso maker and frothing your own milk. much simpler and cheaper!
July 27 2021,2.0,1,ok,but not true espresso. crema is the fake airy crema that you get with pressurized baskets  and the foamed milk isn't really good steamed milk that taste sweet- it's ok for a 'capucino-like' drink- it's not awful  but my machine was beginning to break down after 3 weeks- the drinks it made were no longer piping hot- and it was making a noise- quite loud- this machine puts out way too much pressure for real espresso- 15 bar i think- real espresso needs around 9 bar  even less- the water just goes through too fast to get a real espresso extraction at 15 bar- which is why they give you the pressurized basket so that it comes out looking like real espresso with the fake crema on top- that said though  it makes pretty ok drinks- just not the real stuff- you wont get the complex tastes of a true espresso draw- but the drinks you do get are passable  and pretty ok- i would have given the machine 3 stars because it made pretty ok coffee-like drinks if the water temp was higher and didn't drop off like it did  and the machine didn't develop the loud sound it did-  so i'll have to keep the rating at 2 for this machine because the 'espressos' it created really weren't. i was new to espresso at  the time  and didn't know that pressurized drinks are not espresso- after doing real espressos wit another machine  i learned there is a world of difference between what this machine is capable of and a real espresso machine is-
April 19 2018,1.0,7,very.poor quality,purchased late january.... worked great for a couple months then started having issues with it ..it now wont suck up any cream/milk from the dispenser at all.  i have taken it all apart and cleaned it thoroughly several times to no avale.  our old mr coffee lasted 5 or 7 years and never missed a beat.  i guess we will go back to a model where the frothing isn't automated. novel idea but lacks articulation...sad part is we bought one of our daughters one of these as a  christmas  gift before we bought our own  and she hasn't even opened it yet waiting till she moves into her own place...so chances are hers will probably fail on her too and it will be way past any return date   as is ours even now   i hope their warranty department takes care of us...we will see. update they sent me a new creamer unit and it has worked ok.  but now the pump is failing and will not produce the volume/pressure required to espresso properly...still less then a year old and cleaned many times with vinegar and they are giving me the runaround...do not buy this machine. spend a few bucks more for something of quality
June 1 2020,3.0,2,good espresso  poor instructions  no replacement parts.,the first time instructions are very specific and have to be followed. that said they don't always work. i tried 4 times to get it to prime with no luck. the pump would just run and make a loud noise until it stopped. mine wouldn't prime.i took the tank off the back and checked to make sure the water was flowing. i measured the lever on the tank and it wasn't moving. so i primed it by removing the tank and pouring some water into the machine. that solved the problem. it now works. it would help if that was included in the instructions.if your portafilter breaks  which seems to be a problem  you are out of luck as a replacement part is not available.also  if you want an extra basket for the portafilter don't expect to find it on amazon or any other retail outlet. as usual the amazon search is pretty much useless. it will give you many choices  most of which are not what you are looking for.so essentially the machine does good espresso but it something breaks you are out of luck. mr. coffee will refer you to their retail partners. apparently mr. coffee doesn't carry or won't sell them and their retail partners don't have the parts.i kind of recommend the machine with reservations. replacement parts don't seem to be available.
October 10 2020,5.0,3,three years and still going strong,i did a pretty extensive search before purchasing this one  and figured start cheap  see how quickly it dies  and then justify a fancy machine. we watched for an amazon sale  but even full price  this machine is worth its weight in gold. we have had this cappuccino machine for three years now  so i am going to review it in all its glory.  no  the milk froth isn’t consistent quantity every cup  but there is a custom button to make it just how you like it every single time. we pair this with illy ground espresso for a fantastic morning routine. the only downside is that now we are so spoiled with a daily dose of frothy caffeine  we are forced to buy coffee when we are traveling. i purposefully have forgotten how to insert a k-cup or brew an actual pot of coffee. so  buy it. there are fancier machines out there  but this is the best starter cappuccino machine i’ve seen. oh  and the milk frother and attachments “say” don’t machine wash  but we do and it’s fine.
June 4 2017,5.0,9,i was hesitant about purchasing this particular machine  but my family and i are so glad we purchased it!,i did my research on cafe barista's and i decided to give mr. coffee a try. these little coffee makers can cost in the hundreds and even thousands of dollars  but because of all the decent reviews on amazon concerning this model i purchased it.at first i was going to return this back to amazon because i was concerned that much of the maker is made of plastic. i called mr. coffee and spoke to one of their customer care reps and she guaranteed that all mr. coffee products are bpa free.i decided to keep this and my family and i are amazed how this lil machine can make a latte just as good or better than the big corporate coffee houses out there. i'm totally serious and the mr. coffee barista makes an incredible  most delicious latte  indeed.now i will tell you how i make my latte.8 ounces of silk almond/coconut milk1 full scoop of kona hawaiian ground coffee from kroger1 teaspoon of organic coconut sugari pack 1 full scoop of kona coffee into the filter for single shot of espresso. make sure you place the porta-filter on your counter and put some muscle into packing down your coffee grounds using the measuring scoop/tamper which comes with thiscoffeemaker. by packing my coffee down i believe much of the delicious coffee flavor is extracted from the grounds.there is a line on the froth control knob and i line it up with coffee icon on the machine. i believe the machine gives me the most milk froth where i set the froth control knob.make sure you aim your froth tube into the center of your coffee cup.i push the latte button on the control panel twice for a large latte and out comes my foamy  most delicious  most heavenly milk froth and thanmy kona coffee.it's that easy folks and you will not be disappointed with the purchase of mr. coffee barista. why spend hundreds of dollars on the fancier machines when you can make delicious coffee drinks with this machine. just buy it  you will not be disappointed.
November 30 2021,2.0,3,good and affordable coffee espresso maker but....,this mr. coffee was working good  nice espresso  delicious lattes and cappuccinos but after 15 months of use  the frothing is not working anymore. the milk is cold and no more froth.i have changed my rating from 5 to 2 stars.my last hope is to contact mr. coffee  let's see what they say and will get back to update my review.
December 7 2021,4.0,2,8 months in and...,after 8 months of 2 times a day double shots it's still working great. coffee tastes great but took a long time to get the grind and the tamping pressure right. the portafilter goes in easier and the milk container does as well. however the seal on the milk container connector has loosened  to the point that the inrush of steam causes it to almost pop out of place(sometime it does!) so there is a design flaw unfortunately. and i don't know if it possible to replace it.... but it works great unlike a another brand i tried and it immediately leaked all over my counter what a mess. so price the price i'd say it's a good value ps the screw falling out problem is caused by messing the screw. don't try  to tighten or loosen it! its held on with a special threadlocker most likely.
April 27 2018,5.0,8,keep it clean and it will serve you well  very well in fact.,this machine makes the process simple enough to make a good cup throughout the day and not have too much maintenance in doing so. you still need to clean out the puck  rinse your filter holder and grounds basket  and wipe the milk wand with each use. also know that it continues dripping when done; so  i put an empty cup under it until i can finish my espresso and get back to clean it. but it is very simple to use and tastes great if you have freshly roasted beans and a good burr mill bean grinder set to fine for espresso. drip (store ground) coffee will not work well and is probably stale by the time you buy it from the shelf. my wife loves the double latte and i use the cappuccino setting. replace the coffee grounds press with a simple 50mm one here for $7 (all metal to support a 30 lbs down force) and you will be happy. use a folded towel or better yet a silicone mat or cutting board for the press surface so as not to damage the drip holes on your filter holder. beware that full "foam" setting (at the before 3 o'clock position) will overflow your large 10 oz. coffee cup and run down into the drip tray. make sure your milk tray is not missing the silicone pickup tube inside (mine was  not available to order; but you can make your own with a 3/8" i.d. tube cut about 4 inches long). you will find many tutorials on you tube to get started. enjoy!
February 20 2018,5.0,8,people call me a foodie and i love process while cooking,to be honest i had low expectations  i over research everything.  people call me a foodie and i love process while cooking  doing it right.  i almost hate to admit how much i love this machine though.  i also bought a delonghi espresso maker (the highest rated one) and i use the mr. coffee one most days.  the milk container is so easy to use and makes very good steamed milk and foam.  i love how easy it is and in the early morning  i want simple.  and if i want if different i use the manual option on the buttons.  it makes a great cup of espresso  latte  or cappuccino.  i did get a good grinder though  not the mr. coffee grinder  a baratza.bottom  line is if your trying to impress someone get something else.  if you like variety in your coffee drinks  want simple  easy clean up  and don't want to spend a fortune  well  i don't know of any other machine that does it all.
January 14 2019,2.0,5,poorly designed,while the unit does make what it was intended to make  the quality is poor at best  and the inconsistency of the product in making the same thing twice in a row is extremely poor.  same exact cup used twice with the same settings produces less product  very strange. lattes are not hot as one would normally find in any coffee shop. the unit must be cleaned as stated but that even does not help. the instructions are poorly written at best  and nowhere that i have found does it even mention that u must also clean the parts that are above and inside where the coffee filter attaches. if that area is not cleaned periodically the machine simply does not work properly.  the milk frothing system is a pain in the backside to clean  and the clean setting merily runs hot water through the unit and only flushes out the last run  it does not clean it whatsoever. the manufacturer should at the least provide several proper size small brushes  to clean out the internal piping system. several reviews on the cleaning have been posted and one which is very well written and one i used to try to get the machine to work properly where not effective.  the simple way to explain this is  this machine is ok for the average person  but if your looking for a truely good latte or expresso machine  look at something else.
May 28 2021,2.0,1,worked well for a total of 7 days  then milk  reservoir/frother stopped working,i had gifted this machine to a friend  who is espresso enthusiast a few years ago. he described this as a decent machine for making espressos. i finally gave in and bought one for myself. bear in mind  i am a cappuccino fan. i primed the machine as described and followed all instructions for cleaning it. for the first 7 days  i was able to make amazing custom drinks. loved it. then it happened. milk stopped flowing into the drinks and machine started making loud sounds. i couldn't understand what could have caused this. i watched many videos to troubleshoot but they all wanted me to open up parts and clean it/ run vinegar cycles. i am not a technical person and neither did i have the patience to troubleshoot. i am sure  such issues happen to these machines but you need to be willing to put time into it to rectify them by watching youtube videos. i think  i'll buy a nespresso with a separate frother. that seems less of a hassle. this one  buy with caution and awareness. good luck
October 10 2016,5.0,121,a good european electric one w/o a frother,i went on amazon to purchase my 3rd keurig frothing pitcher (they are such junk that they self-destruct starting a month after purchasing & are unusable 6 to 9 months out)  when i noticed mr. coffee had an espresso machine with a milk frothing device.  i thought  mr. coffee  that's a company (unlike keurig) which one can trust to make a well engineered product.  (i now have 3 mr. coffee burr coffee grinders  so i reason to believe this was so.)  so i bought it  & can say  it took a little time to get into a routine of using it without spilling coffee grinds all over the place.i have purchased several espresso makers over the years  a good european electric one  w/o a frother  a good senseo w/o frother that requires pods  a  that makes good but weak espresso  an expensive european stainless steel stove top one w/o frother that makes strong espresso  the keurig that requries expensive pods  makes bad espresso  takes too much time to use  is in every way poorly engineered  and has a milk frother that costs about $35 to replace every 6 to 9 months merely because it is made of cheap plastic.with all that in mind & with the mr. coffee machine routine mastered  i can say  & my partner says every day  the mr. coffee machine makes the best tasting espresso/cappuccino ever experienced  better than starbucks by far  better than all my other espresso machines  better milk frothing too  better engineered by far at such a reasonable price and without expensive pods (where who knows where the coffee is from).if mr. coffee comes up with a new & improved espresso machine w/milk frother  i will purchase that one too  not the least of which is because i appreciate a supporting an excellent company that makes the investment in research & development to come up with a great product that does what the customer is led to believe it should do.
December 7 2021,3.0,5,stopped frothing,this worked so well for about a week. then it stopped frothing. i did all the troubleshooting  had kept it clean. i have no idea what happened  but all the milk comes out flat now. sad.
May 27 2020,1.0,3,absolute garbage for quality !,ok... this is now my fourth machine in about 7 yrs.  i kept thinking that i must have been unlucky and received a rare faulty machine so i ordered yet another one. hey....they cost less than $200....  so yes  it makes a decent/good latte and all  it's nice and compact  it's easy to use  etc... but they never last !  these machines have a very well known problem with their milk frothers.... they stop frothing within a year or two  or in my case  this last machine stopped frothing after 6 months! and believe me... i know that you have to use the built in clean function after each use. i always do. plus i hand rinse out all the components of the milk frother as well. i've had it with this junk.  do not buy these !
February 13 2020,1.0,5,frother stopped working after 3 months - very disappointed,***edited to add: i gave a glowing report of this machine earlier  but now - after only 3 months of owning it - the frother has stopped working. i diligently cleaned it after each use and have run vinegar through the machine as recommended. i wouldn’t mind having it replaced since it has a one year warranty  but the company is making me jump through a lot of hoops to do so. i’m looking for another replacement that will last a reasonable amount of time. very disappointed.***i have spent way too much money at starbucks over the years and decided this year to save money and make my favorite drink (a mocha) at home. i’ve had my machine for a month and love it! it’s very easy to use  and my mochas are perfect. i wish i would have gotten one of these a long time ago. i use skim and almond milk along with torani chocolate sauce i bought at the local grocery and starbucks pike place coffee. it makes a wonderful froth that can be adjusted according to preference. i get everything ready the night before so it only takes a few minutes in the mornings. i don’t usually leave reviews but had to for this because i like it so much.
February 25 2022,1.0,1,worked great for 2 months  then broke - sent it in under warrenty and they never sent a replacement.,i order this and loved it for the 2 months it worked. then the milk frother stopped working.  called warranty support and sent it in with a pre-paid shipping label. was told i would have a new one shipped as soon as they received it.  they received it early december and as of feb 25th  i still do not have a replacement.  i have called about 6 times and have been told everything from they are out of stock  to they are sending me a check back for the paid amount.  but after 3 months i just gave up.  every call took 90 minutes and was a exercise in patience.  mr. coffee is a brand that does not stand behind their products.
March 23 2020,4.0,1,it could be better (and it is after lime cleaning)  but it's a solid 4 stars for the price.,it took me almost a month to write this review. even though this is probably the easiest latte machine you could possibly buy  there are still a couple of variables that will take you some time to work out if you've never had an espresso machine before. the variables that will affect the quality of your drink are as follows:1. coffee quality and grind size (please buy whole bean and grind yourself with a quality grinder).2. amount of espresso you try to cram into the porta-filler.3. temperature of the water coming from the machine.4. level-ness and tamp pressure you put on the espresso in the porta-filler.for #1: buying a whole bean from a local roaster that is as fresh as possible is ideal. buying it whole bean is even more important. the quality and taste of the coffee declines quickly as soon as it is ground  even in a bag you re-seal. in a coffee container that is air-tight like the coffee gator  it will last a bit longer  but still. just buy whole bean and suck it up. next  the grinder should be a burr type grinder (i bought the mueller conical burr grinder). finally  dialing in the grind size is important. at first i went with the smallest grind setting on the grinder  but it wasn't ideal. the grounds were too small and didn't allow enough head pressure to get through the machine. result was poor tasting espresso with no crema. i settled on '3' on the mueller which is on a 1 (finest) to 10 scale.for #2 and #4: i battled with this for way too long. everything online says to put 13-18 grams of coffee into a double porta-filler. the most i could ever get was 15 and that was after tamping the hell out of it so i could cram more and more in. result was same as #1 with too fine a grind. i finally threw the common internet wisdom for grams out the window and just did it by logic and feel. numbers wise  it's somewhere around 11g of grinds. logic-wise it's 'fill to top of porta-fill. tap tap tap on the counter to settle and even it. fill again from grinder to top. tap tap tap to even. take your tamper (buy the nice heavy metal one for 15 bucks) and apply force as evenly as possible. don't do 30lbs of pressure like they say online. with a home machine like this with 15 pressure head  30lbs of tamp force is way too much and will barely allow the water pressure to come through making terrible coffee. just do a nice twist/push with a little bit of weight/pressure. try to get the puck as even as possible.for #3: this one was weird. i measured the temp of the water coming directly out of the pump with a hand held thermometer. it was consistently around 155-163d. this is not nearly hot enough. online  the consensus is 180-190d. i thought the machine was broken  but i read a review or two that said to descale it and it would help. on a new machine? weird  but it works. i didn't have vinegar  so i used clr mixed with water. i ran a full reservoir of that mixed solution  then a full reservoir of just clean water. result? water temps were instantly 180-187d. fixed. we are on a well on top of a mountain so we have hard minerals. i have to do this about every 2 weeks  but it's worth it.overall i am happy. even with the above  the consistency of my pour/shot varies (which i hate!). it's pretty dialed in where i'll only pull a crappy non-crema shot once in ten tries. when that happens  i'm still not 100% clear on if i didn't follow my own advice above closely/carefully enough or if the machine can just be inconsistent sometimes. you can tell instantly how good the shot is going to be. for a double  it should be about 5 seconds of dark coffee coming out  followed by 10 seconds of perfect looking crema  followed by 5 seconds of slightly watered down looking crema. you can kill the watery crema by hitting the espresso button on the machine again. when you are pulling a really crappy shot  you will get dark coffee followed by what looks like really watery coffee. i have no idea why this happens. will update this if i nail it down. otherwise  9/10 times it makes great espresso shots!the latte portion of this machine works great and just as advertised. sometimes if you put it on latte as ooposed to espresso froth it can jip you a little bit on the amount of steamed milk it gives you. if this happens  just run the latte cycle again and stop it manually when you have the amount of froth you want.cleaning is pretty easy  but takes some time. you have to keep pushing the clean cycle every time it ends. i wish it would just do it continuously until the water runs out.i tried a couple of other machines and espresso specific machines. none of them were worth the hassle and this mr coffee is so much easier/time saving. the espresso specific machines i tried from delonghi took way too much time to make myself a latte in the morning because of the separate frother. yea  i know 1st world problems but between setting it up  making it  and cleaning it we're talking 10-15 min vs 5. when you have to run to work that time savings makes a difference.overall  i'm really happy with it after figuring things out. will update is something crazy happens.
December 5 2019,2.0,2,parts department in the philippines,the machine arrived quickly and i used the mr. coffee barista the next day i thought finally mr. coffee makes a decent espresso cappuccino and latte with automatic frother machine and the finished products tasted surprisingly good but........just try and call mr. coffee's website customers service dept???? by the way it's located that's right in the philippens!!!! i asked them if i could order some parts for my new barista she asked what did i want to order i said a porta filter she then said what's that  i thought really you are supposed to work in the parts dept. and you don't know what a porta filter is???? i shouldn't have asked but i asked her what size is the porta filter in millimeters she said i don't know i then asked her to put me on hold and please ask someone she gladly said ok and 23 mins later!!!!! she came back on the phone and you guessed it they did not know and besides she said we don't carry a lot of extra parts here... really!! don't buy mr. coffee products!! you will be disappointed  terrible after sale customer service and trust me if you buy the mr.coffee barista you are going to need to order some spare parts within the first couple of months!! spend a little more and be happy with your new espresso machine!
February 22 2022,5.0,0,good product for unmatchable price,we've had this 2yrs and use it pretty much every day.  latte machines are often ridiculously priced  so this one's a breath of fresh air.  easy to use - you just put in the grounds  milk  and water  then press a button and voila - tasty latte!tips:1.  skip to the double-shot - you're never gonna want a single.2.  clean regularly.  it's milk  so yeah  it likes to go bad.  use the self-cleaning feature before putting the milk container back in the fridge.  wash the whole milk container out every few days  taking every removable piece apart and scrubbing (yes  i even unscrewed the top once for a super-deep-cleaning  but only after 2yrs of use).3.  other creamers work too!  in order of preference:  2% milk (fattier works but can clog easier)  super creamer  oatmilk (nut pod is a great brand)  almond milk  soy.  some froth better than others.  mix with milk for best of both worlds :).4.  buy a cheap bean grinder so you can buy whole beans for extra flavor (but i also buy pre-ground coffee bags too  especially for decaf).5.  enjoy!
August 21 2017,5.0,6,coffeehouse-quality lattes for less than $1!,i'm saving so much money with this espresso/latte maker and the drinks taste (almost) as good. this machine can pull excellent espresso shots; as good as a much more expensive machine. the milk frother -- not so much. but  i can make a double cafe mocha for less than a dollar! and when i want to get "fancy"  i can do the drink manually by first pouring the frothed milk into a pitcher  then pull the espresso shots into my mug. then  tamp/stir the milk and pour it into the espresso. can't do latte art  but the drink tastes great!suggestions after several months of use:1. let the machine heat up with the (empty) portafilter in place and the mug on top for 15 minutes if you have time. get everything nice and hot. just note that the portafilter will get very hot. nothing worse than a lukewarm latte.2. keep the milk ice cold until you're ready to froth it. this will keep the hard sticky foam to a minimum.3. use freshly-ground beans if you have a grinder. i'm using pre-ground because i don't have a grinder and the coffee has lost its oil after a few weeks and no longer makes a nice thick crema.4. for the best results (if you have time)  pull the espresso and the milk separately as i mention above. this gives you control over the milk content and allows you to "work" the milk a little to remove the big bubbles before adding it to the drink.5. keep the whole machine as clean as possible including the milk container  hoses  spouts  filters and trays. milk and coffee build up if you don't.6. go ahead and buy a real tamper. they're less than $20 and are much better than the plastic thing that comes with the machine.
January 15 2020,5.0,1,simple to use  clean  and makes great tasting espresso/lattes/cappuccinos.,update: 1/25/2020 - added a picture of a brewed latte.review of: mr. coffee - espresso and cappuccino makerreviewed by: the examinatorproduct rating: 5 out of 5packaging rating: 4 out of 5summary: simple to use  clean  and makes great tasting espresso/lattes/cappuccinos.for details as to how this item received the given rating  see below:this little machine makes three things: espresso  cappuccino and lattes. with good coffee  all three of these come out fantastic. when first purchased we thought it was going to be low end or seem janky  however  it has proved us wrong. it's well built  easy to clean and extremely easy to operate.you fill the reservoir in the back with filtered water  power it on and wait for it to warm up (which does not take long)  scoop in the coffee in one of two sizes/shots  attach  and select your option. there is an additional step if you want to make lattes and add froth by using the accessory "milk" reservoir.*note  we reference "milk" based on your preference (dairy or non-dairy)we drink almond milk and have had no issues with the attachment  the frothing or delivery of the "milk" from the reservoir. when done  the cleanup is a few steps  from dumping the coffee grounds from the handle attachment  rinsing that out (which comes apart in 3 pieces)  then rinsing out the "milk" reservoir  filling it with water and running it through it's self clean cycle. all of these which take a few moments.the results are fantastic! this is such a great addition to our kitchen and especially if you enjoy coffee in it's various forms.the packaging used minimal plastic and appeared to be store drop off acceptable  which was a plus. no plastic would be best  but one day we will get there.pros: • easy to use. • simple to clean. • offers three options (espresso  cappuccino  and lattes). • the maker comes with two size attachments (single or double shot). • comes with a coffee scoop that has a multi purpose (to compress the coffee or scrape excess). • comes with a "milk" reservoir.cons: • none*note  there are two ratings applied to the reviewed item. "product rating" and "packaging rating". the actual product will not be impacted by the packaging as these are two separate ratings.in regards to packaging  the following are contributing factors against the "packaging rating": • in an effort to globally reduce and promote less usage of plastic  any usage of plastic or non-environmentally safe packaging/products/material will be marked negatively. • single use items that do not biodegrade or cannot be easily recycled (see point above on plastics). • the packaging rating is being introduced to help drive a shift to more sustainable and environmentally friendly resources.
October 21 2019,5.0,2,awesome  affordable lattes,i love this machine! i've had mine for almost a year  and it has worked perfectly (and tirelessly) the entire time. i make 2-3 lattes per day  as a rule  so i use the heck out of this thing. the lattes i make with this machine are so much better than the ones i used to get from a well-known coffee house (and way cheaper).if you take the time to properly clean it and take care of it  it should perform well. i do not use commercial cleaners. i use a mixture of white vinegar and water to clean and descale the machine. this method works perfectly  so there's no need in spending the money (or contaminating yourself with toxic chemicals) from commercial cleaners.i bought mine when it was on sale  so i got a great deal. i think it's totally worth the regular retail price  though  especially when you take into consideration how much lattes cost at a coffee house. the money you'll save by making your own makes this investment worth it.it is a great little machine that makes lattes  espresso  and cappuccino. i highly recommend this one!
December 7 2018,2.0,4,replacement parts diffulities,i do like this product - it made a good espresso/latte.  replacement parts became an issue.  their system is antiquated and incomplete.the double espresso holder thing ended up in my disposal - when i went to look for the replacement part on line you could find the single but not the double.  eesh  - called them (half an hour on hold just to get through)  but they were so so nice and sent me a replacement for free.  inconvenient but nice.unfortunately then we lost the small plastic tube which fits inside the milk reservoir and sucks the milk up into the frothing apparatus.this became a major issue.  i attempted to order what i thought was the right piece from their website....there was no picture but it seemed right.....it wasn't...it came and was wrong (it was the little silver tube that fits over the frothing tube).  so i went back on the website - no other tubes to be found  - called them - apparently you can't order this piece by itself (ridiculous as this is the piece that is most likely to get lost or damaged) - you have to order the entire milk unit - omg- really!  they very nicely said they would send me a new one for free but two weeks later and it's still not here - i've now been going to starbucks for my lattes for the last month due to  a non-functioning machine.  i called them yesterday - 45 minutes on hold to just talk to a human being and  about twenty minutes more trying to figure it out - a call back from a supervisor who still did not know what was going on.  all for a simple plastic/silicone part.the supervisor was supposed to figure it out and call me back to let me know what's going on - still no call back.  i've given up and am ordering a new machine from another company - i just don't know what else to do.  i would like to have a machine where i could easily order replacement parts for the small items that are actually likely to need to be replaced.
December 4 2021,1.0,2,a sad disappointment,bought as our first espresso machine. it worked amazing the first 3 months. and i’m not talking about just worked well. it worked perfect we were having 6-8 cappuccinos a day for 3 months. at the exact 3 month the milk stopped steaming and the water didn’t have enough pressure. i tried to contact amazon support but it was too late for returning it. tried contacting mr. coffee costumer support without success. i reached out to amazon again and they helped me with a return and refund. amazing support after i complained 10 times. i’ve saved a little bit more money and got a braville barista. and booooy!!! that thing is just amazing.long story short. it is a great machine but will let you down.
August 19 2020,1.0,2,to much,i thought this would be the answer to my black coffee and cappuccino desires but it’s not.  although the machine makes a good tasting coffee it’s a real pain to make. it takes way to many steps to prepare  only makes one cup at a time and cleaning is another process. you can’t see the top of the coffee filter  to clean it you have to either bend down and look up to see it or put the coffee machine in the sink and turn it over to spray it clean with the water nozzle. the locking device which holds the coffee filter has left me many times cleaning up an absolute mess because you can’t see where it locks  you just have to take your chances and hope its locks in place. it’s just not my cup of tea.
November 8 2019,3.0,2,quit working after 6 months,i had high hopes for this given the cost but after using it for 6 months the steaming/frothing mechanism has quit working properly. it barely dribbles when it should be pouring out which puts maybe a teaspoon of milk into the latte or cappuccino instead of a few ounces or more. the espresso part works fine and i have no complaints about it but i bought it for the frothing and steaming and having a "fancy coffee shop" drink which i no longer have. i have cleaned it properly and done everything i know and it seems to be an internal issue.i’m updating this review because i have figured out that if you use just milk or half and half it will properly disperse but i had been using heavy cream and it will not disperse that  i’m guessing it’s too heavy  thick or oily? anyway it’s working again just fine as long as i use half and half or milk. i think it should be designed better so you could use cream but at least it works and its not a total waste.
February 6 2016,2.0,15,my review updated 2 years into ownership.,over the years i have bought 4 machines that ranged from $100-$500.  this is without a doubt the best of the bunch which actually shocked me.  better then a $500 silvia.  how can a cheap mr. coffee be better then a $500 italian machine?  it is incredible easy to make a perfect cup of coffee. you push a button and 1 minute later have a perfect latte or espresso.  it's very easy to tweak it as well  you want more coffee less milk  or more milk less coffee  or just frothed milk for cocoa or just a shot of coffee...it's as easy as the push of a button.  i have used this machine 2-3 times a day for 2 months and have had no issues.  not one.  great great product.update:  a year after purchasing this machine it stopped producing coffee.  it still frothed milk but wouldn't build up enough pressure for coffee.  they sent me a new one.  that was wonderful except that here i am another year later and the exact same thing has happened.  i only only use distilled water and make 2 cups/day.  this is a wonderful machine if you can afford to buy a new one each year.
March 8 2022,5.0,2,get it,i've been having this machine for  almost a year..  so far i really like it and i use it about 2x a day . i haven't went to a coffee  shop since i got this.i like how you can easily customize your drink .i use almond milk and the foam is perfect. .my favorite is the starbucks espresso and it's so easy to make an iced caramel machiatto.the inconsistencies are true sometimes my lattes/ cappuccinos are different. also  when i do a cleaning cycle it throws water into the milk dispenser.and sometimes the temperature of the latte/cappuccinos are different .it is a little loud but i don't mind it.over all i still think it is worth it if you like coffee. i really hope they sell the milk dispenser because i dropped it and broke but luckily from a place where i can still use it.
June 15 2018,4.0,5,love it!!!,update: i wish you could control the milk temp. ive qlso found that i can only leave milk in the milk container for two days if i make one coffee a day  otherwise it spoils! make sure you clean milk container pieces well!!love my cafe barista!! the only two changes i would recommed would be a sturdier handle for the espresso/ coffee portion along with coffee tamper. the machine could be a little more stylish as well. honestly after reading tons of reviews for $200-$500 espresso machines i can’t say enough good about it! its already lessened my coffee trips on the run to virtually none!! great flavored coffee  good warranty. the only think latte lovers may not like is hoq much froth it makes in your latte but you can always skim that off- doesnt bother me!i love that you can customize the amount of milk/ froth and cuatolize the shot pull. this was a great buy!!mark this review a helpful if you find it to be
November 15 2020,5.0,1,super easy espresso  latte or cappuccino maker,this machine makes it easy to make either an espresso  or a latte and or a cappuccino. add coffee  add milk  press the right button and you got a great cappuccino. of course the quality of your coffee and water affects the taste. i recommend to use finely ground espresso coffee  a regular ground filter machine coffee won’t taste that good.the scooper which comes with the machine works really well  the back end is flat to press the coffee in the holder  good design.the coffee holder is a little light  i hope it will last. our old barista was much better quality.but cleaning the machine is a breeze :-)very well designed  the cleaning program does it almost completely automatically. all you have to do is rinse the milk container. very happy with the machine  it also looks nice on the counter.
October 13 2019,5.0,1,easy and quick,so my wife got hooked on lattes on her trip to spain this summer.  she asked me to find the best of the inexpensive espresso machines.  we've been using this for six and a half months now and she is very happy with it.  we use it to brew two to four lattes (or cappuccinos) a day.  if you take into account grinding the coffee and the machine warming up  it takes about five minutes to make a two shot latte.  the kids also love hot chocolate made with the steamed milk.  it is a bit plasticky  but with a little care it looks like it will last a while.***update***so after 14 month  it stopped frothing.  you could hear the pump trying to pump  but nothing would come out.  i read a review on here that had the same problem and solved it by reading the manual and deliming the machine.  it took quite a few clean cycles  but it finally pushed the plug through and is back to working 100%.sure made the wife happy that it is fixed.  actually  i was on here intending to buy another one to replace this one when i found the review.  we liked the ease of this machine so much that we decided that even at just 14 months  it was well worth it.  i figure with the cost of the machine and the coffee for 14 months at ~2.5 cups a day  it came to about 30 cents a cup.  way cheaper than the $4+ per cup we'd pay at a coffee shop.  and now that it's working again  the cost per cup is going to keep coming down.the manual (when you actually read it) recommends deliming it every 80 cups.  i figured we were over 1000 cups.  we'll start deliming a little more frequently and expect years more of use out of it.still a five star rating!
January 26 2022,5.0,1,i would buy it again.,i've had this machine for a little over a year. i love it. one can choose between either making an espresso  a cappuccino  or a latte. i usually choose the latte setting  and i usually need more froth milk than it automatically provides. so i love the fact that i can push one of the buttons and control how much more froth is produced until it's enough for my taste. i also like the cleaning setting where you push the button and it automatically will clean where the milk is suspensed and where the coffee is dispensed. then it automatically shuts off.
May 10 2021,2.0,1,i *did* love this machine,this machine makes an excellent cappuccino with little ease. the automatic frother is fantastic!but...it clogs terribly. the screen in the pod is constantly getting clogged. i tried scrubbing with a toothbrush  soaking in vinegar  nope.  i ordered a replacement from mr coffee and it's a cheap after market pod!!!!  someone suggested holding it over a burner to clean it and that worked extremely well. i thought i was back on track to loving this machine...nope.  i've had this machine for a little over a year. the first cup of coffee is barely luke warm. and now the frother refuses to work. it spits out a few drops of milk and then nothing but steam.i am so disappointed!!!  i loved this machine  but it's a total piece of crap.  :'(
July 31 2017,5.0,6,great value  great cuppa,i wanted a simple cappuccino and once in a while latte. the thought of having steamed milk froth was my main objective. this machine does it all. i shuddered at the thought of getting into the world of 'pulling the perfect shot of espresso' and have shied away from buying any machine for years. the mr. coffee cafe barista is the solution for me. simple and delicious.as i sit here sipping my cappuccino after a week of use i'm very happy with my purchase. here's why.1. the operation is simple and the front of the machine has icons that i would hope anyone can follow. i can.2.  it makes a very good cuppa whatever you want. maybe not for the gourmet  but it does it for me.3.  the price is great.there were some problems with what filter came with the machine. instead of the promised two there was only one and mr. coffee is going through some kind of a transition with whether they will include the double shot filter. i called and they sent what i needed but only after asking for a supervisor.i make chai tea latte's often and this is a great machine for that. i simply grind my loose tea finer and put it in the filter and treat it like latte from there! rooibos  assam and chai spices all make a great drink.finally  the machine has cleaning modes for both the milk container and the espresso filter. i recommend reading the manual as it's super easy to follow and the questions and answers are needlessly complicated here.
September 9 2021,1.0,0,hasn’t worked properly since it arrived.,i am so disappointed by this machine. it had issues when it first arrived but i assumed it was user error. over time those issues which include varying amounts of coffee being made from the same button mode and turning on randomly without prompt have gotten worse and worse. i simply cannot use it anymore due to the technical issues. it leaks all over the counter when not being used  the milk frother doesn’t respond to being dialed back(it over foams every drink)  the latte button dispenses varying amounts every use(not consistent at all) and the espresso filter hardly fits in the machine. i am certain this is a faulty machine based on reviews and videos and hours of pouring over the manuals and retrying to clean it and pressurize it correctly. when the switch is on  its running water non stop through the espresso portion. for how costly this machine is  i would expect better quality control.
September 7 2020,1.0,2,don’t buy,works great for 8 months daily use and with manufacturer guidelines for cleaning the milk  canister and parts after every use. i can no longer use despite it working functionally bc the foam frother parts smell rank even after dissasembly and reassembly of trying to clean the joints and parts within the lid of the frother.still under warranty but no one responds to the email way of warranty requests and the automated phone line links you to a third party company that is to handle these things for them and the website says due to covid they do not respond via email or phone to warranty requests.so don’t buy. u won’t get your money worth more does it make a latte big enough
February 26 2018,2.0,5,could be amazing  instead is inconsistent,this coffee machine could be wonderful! i love how easy it is to use. i love the temperature of the coffee. i love the option to manually or automatically brew. i love the auto clean function. however  it doesn’t brew consistent cups! i have not had this machine for more than two months and only use distilled water. the first week  my cups were perfect. after the first week  the lattes are not consistently sized. sometimes a lot of milk comes out and cry little espresso. sometimes the opposite occurs. sometimes the proportions seem correct  but both are smaller or larger amounts than usual. sometimes my cup is half full and sometimes it overflows! it’s a hassle to have to manually brew the espresso and milk  especially since i bought this machine for the convenience of being able to push a button and walk away  come back and my coffee is done. i’m very disappointed about this. it wouldn’t be as bad if the proportions of milk to espresso were always consistent  just the amount in total was different. however  sometimes i have a cup of basically all milk with just a hint of espresso  and this is extremely disappointing as well as a waste of grounds if i didn’t notice that the grounds were barely used before throwing th away.
May 11 2020,1.0,1,statistically speaking it will probably break,if you read the one and two-star reviews here  they all basically say the same thing. our story is no different. got the machine. loved the machine. after about 3 weeks the dedicated latte and cappuccino functions stopped working; the machine would produce variable amounts of foam  sometimes pumping it out continuously until we'd have to press the button to stop it. we sent the machine back  and received a replacement. after a few weeks  same problem occurred. i decided to keep the machine and just use the manual foam button for the milk. then about 3 months later  the pump completely broke - no more foam  no more espresso. amazon allowed us to return the machine past the return window  which we're grateful for. it's unfortunate this machine tends to break because it's easy to use and maintain when it works  and it makes great espresso. i would advise you to look elsewhere though - there definitely seems to be a manufacturing defect for this machine.
February 18 2020,3.0,1,very good espresso machine for this $$. milk frothing inconsistent  now not working at all,i just realized that i did not review this product. i have to say  it did great job on espresso. over the period of 14 months i own this machine  and doing 4 espressos every day  it holds up really well. temperature of espresso is the same as when the machine was new (175f). i have 0 complains about that.now frothing - very inconsistent. even same milk  same temperature  amounts of frothed milk vary significantly. we had to use "manual" mode  to get the right amounts for our cappuccino.  same with late.two weeks ago  frothing stopped completely. machine is not sucking milk  just makes noise. cleaning cycle is also not working. i contacted service dept  they did some troubleshooting  but nothing they can help with to fix it. there are no internal spare parts i can buy and my only option is authorized dealer.i paid $108 for this machine on amazon. knowing that frothing will die in year of use  i would buy it for that price again  but not full retail.update: so approximately after 2500 espressos  outcome became very inconsistent. espressos differs in temperature and taste  even using same fresh ground. that's after all the cleaning. it's time to let go..
July 3 2019,1.0,1,update - avoid this product - it will fail to perform.,after some 400 cups of coffee  the foaming pump has failed entirely.  despite proper cleaning  there is not enough steam to suck milk from the reservoir and produce foam.  instead a dribble of warm very dilute watery milk is delivered.mr coffee support has been completely useless.  written responses appear to be by illiterate individuals unable to read the consumer request.  the 800-number is always busy and offers no call-back feature.  in short: mr coffee products is a transactional group that cares little for the customer  except taking the money for inferior products.updated  update:  i completely disassembled the product to determine why the failure.  here's the reason for failure:  all  boilers are aluminum.  the boiler that feeds the coffee (espresso) maker is aluminum.  the separate boiler that feeds the foamer is aluminum.  neither of the aluminum boilers have proper coating to prevent corrosion of the aluminum.  the espresso pot style boiler that feeds a silicone hose of approx. 3/16th inch diameter; therefore the sloughing off pieces of deteriorated aluminum pass.  however  the screen through which the boiled water passes becomes clogged.  the boiler feeding the foam  is well designed for quick steam but routing water through a maze.  the hot water corrodes the aluminum resulting in the same white pieces sloughing off the maze.  however  this very high temperature water (close to boiling  212 f) and carries dissolved 'crud' into other parts of the foaming system where they are deposited as the water cools.  the end result is an accumulation of aluminum crud clogging and restricting the high rate of  flow of very hot water that is needed to aspirate milk from the reservoir and produce foam.the design is very good   but the materials used are not suitable for the purpose (only suitable for profits of mr coffee).
October 8 2017,2.0,6,plastic overkill and anything but simple,i returned this item because i was disappointed in the amount of plastic and the design was annoying. flavor was decent and i probably could have perfected it with a few more tries  but it wasn't worth it to me for a product i didn't love. overall  this unit may work for some people  but i didn't love it and three figures is too costly for something i don't love.design flaws:1) taller travel-height mugs don't fit;2) the milk dispenser is made of plastic made to look like metal (would it really have been that costly to use food grade stainless steel here?);3) the "metal" lever that adjusts the milk dispenser nozzle is also made of cheap plastic  and doesn't feel like it will last;4) unit is obnoxiously loud and took multiple cycles for me to get enough milk5) the milk dispenser nozzle is an accident waiting to happen because it must be pointed towards the mug every time (the mug can't be placed or removed if the nozzle is left in the dispensing position)  and i could see myself forgetting to move it if i was tired or trying to multi-task;6) the milk reservoir is huge  doesn't include markings  and has a plastic lid with a straw that is required for operation -- might be okay if you intend to store the entire reservoir in the fridge  but i wanted a quick pour  steam  wash option.
February 12 2021,5.0,1,bought this for my dad and he loves it,my dad is a big coffee drinker and his old machine unfortunately broke so we bought him this one and to this day he uses it every single day at all times of day. brings 2 sizes for the amount of coffee you want to put and it brings a container to put the milk for your cappuccinos. the clean up for the machine is very simple and doesn’t require much   i do want to inform though that this is only good for small to medium sized mugs so if you plan on putting taller cups of coffee it won’t fit. besides that the machine comes with a mini recipe panflet where you can make different coffees with and without liquors. it brings a spoon for your coffee grounds too which is always great highly recommend buying it if you want to save extra money on coffee
May 24 2019,4.0,1,okay product for a single person,[6th month update] i had to take away one star because of the inconsistent performance of the milk frother. i clean the frother after every use and still  most of the time i get barely any milk and every now and then i get way too much. i always use the frother in the max setting for cappuccino. this part of the caffe barista has turned out to be a big disappointment. [end of update]i've been using my café barista for two weeks  and every cup of coffee i've made has been a huge success. it is not a perfect machine  but it is worth the asking price.espressothis was the main reason i bought this machine for. all the power i crave from coffee in only 2.5 ounces of liquid for the double shot. i'm not a coffee snob so i won't tell you that you need to grind your own beans from some obscure origin no one has heard of. i buy ground espresso coffee at the supermarket (café bustelo if you must know)  and it comes out beautiful with crema on top and the right espresso flavor!cappuccinothe café barista makes good cappuccinos and mochaccinos. the milk frother does a good job and you end up with a foamy coffee delight.lattei'm not into lattes so i can't comment on the performance for these. i only use the latte button for the cleaning cycle.cleaning and maintenancethis is probably the biggest sore point of the café barista  and yet it is not that huge of a deal. between the wait for things to cool down so you can empty the used ground coffee  and running the cleaning cycle(s)  the daily cleaning routine will feel like a lot. as a result  this may not be your ideal coffeemaker for having some coffee as you rush to get ready to go to work in the morning. but even then  this machine is so worth its money as a weekend coffeemaker.final thoughtsone seemingly confusing point about the café barista is how many people it would serve in one use. basically  this is a coffeemaker for a single person  despite the water and milk reservoirs holding much more liquid than any person will ever need. if you want to make coffee for two or more people  you will need to buy extra coffee holders and handles for each person  as the single coffee handle assembly that's included will get too hot during use  preventing you from emptying and refilling the ground coffee quickly enough to keep the coffee going for the rest of your family.
February 1 2021,2.0,1,not built to last,i've owned this item since late 2018 and it's finally giving up the ghost.  i've definitely saved money overall by not hitting up my local coffee shops  but it's not built to last and i don't think i'll buy a mr. coffee brand again.  from the start i couldn't even get a simple replacement filter gasket  and customer service was useless.  also  this unit seriously couldn't make up it's mind how much milk it wanted to dispense on any setting  with any level of milk in the reservoir.  i couldn't leave the unit alone to do it's job or i'd come back to milk everywhere or barely any milk at all.  point of the review is this.  you get what you pay for.  love espresso drinks?  think about maybe spending a tad more and getting something industrial.  casual coffee drinker.  this may be okay for you for awhile.
March 2 2022,1.0,1,doest turn on after few uses. broken,this mr coffee broken after few coups of coffee. in the middle of making cup stop working and there is no power in maker. called amazon they said returning/replecing policy is only 30 days  and i bought that 55 days ago but just used few times. they said there is factory warrenty and they connected me to mr coffee agent. thats the worst customer service ever!!! spend over hour waiting for someone to help me with that issue. when i ask for replace or money back they agree to sent me money back but in 8 weeks!! after i will return them the broken one! people dont waste your money and time and buy something else. i will never go back to mrcoffee. amazon costumer service was ok.
March 4 2022,5.0,0,brew it yourself and save money!,brew it yourself and save money! had this system since christmas 2021. it has already paid for itself. impo  it is the most complete  reliable and cost-effective solution to your morning caffeine requirement. cleaning is essential. the milk container is easily removed for refrigerator storage. however  this should also be cleaned every few drinks and takes an extra few minutes. absolutely no problems with this model however  we did purchase the extended warranty as a few of the reviews indicated failure after several months. this has never failed to brew our morning cups of hot liquid energy. highly recommended. with ease of use  easy cleaning and reliability  this may be the model you are looking for! take care of it and it'll take care of you!
June 7 2019,1.0,1,dangerously dirty milk foamer. impossible to get really clean,i would have given this 5 stars for making an amazing cup of foamy latte with a ton of milk foam  but there is a glaring and potentially dangerous issue with this espresso  machine. the milk in the container goes through a white flexible tube  that plugs into the black lid of the milk foamer. then the milk shoots through parts of the lid and into the metal tube which sits in your cup. i have been taking it all apart and using a tiny brush to clean inside the tubes. what i did not realize is that where the two tubes plug into the black lid of the milk foamer there are tiny holes that you cannot get to and can barely see when you clean the black lid. i was washing the lid and noticed some white stuff inside those holes. i took a tiny brush to it and the white stuff was caked on milk that had been there for who knows how long. i cannot even get a good picture because the holes are tiny and they are up inside the lid. but after i scrubbed inside the tiny holes in the black lid  huge chunks of old milk came out of the lid. i tried unscrewing the screws in the lid to take it apart to clean but even after you take out the screws it does not open. i think this machine could harbor some nasty or even deadly bacteria. i am really horrified that i have been using it for months not realizing my milk foam was being shot through old crusted milk this whole time.  i'm going back to the old steamer that you put inside a metal cup and make your foam by hand. i don't want legionairres disease or any other disease i can get from the disgusting old milk that gets trapped in this thing.
August 10 2020,1.0,0,stops working within two months  don't waste your time or money,final update:11/3/2020: finally got a hold of someone and everything was eventually taken care of (returned machine-again-and recieved refund in mail). this was still the worst coffee and consumer experience  and i strongly recommend against buying this machine. it did not work for very long  which seems to be a common problem  and it was extremely difficult getting a hold of anyone. if you really want a more hands on espressso experience  just save a little more and buy a better/more reliable machine. if you don't care about the experience and just want some good lattes/tasty drinks  get a nespresso vertuo pod machine. delivers good coffee  consistently  and is user-friendly and reliable.10/23/2020: this has been the absolute worst experience i have ever had with any consumer brand service. after speaking with multiple representatives about returning the defective espresso maker  i was assured that i would be receiving a refund. instead  they shipped out a new machine  which i expressly stated i did not want as i had already bought a different machine. i had been in a decent back and forth communication with the representative rouella marie  with them responding within 24 hours. since their last message stating they ordered a replacement to be shipped out to me  it has been radio silence despite several email attempts. i am frankly appalled by the mr. coffee customer service  as i was told i’d be getting a refund only to find out they were sending a new & unwanted machine instead. i am now out $180  and can not get in contact with anyone.do not buy this machine-as it will break quickly and it it impossible to get a hold of anyone.10/12/2020: just about two months in to having this machine and the milk frother stopped working. and by "stopped working" i mean it absolutely does not function-the milk is not being pulled from the reservoir and into the cup. i run a clean cycle after every use  so it is definitely not due to any blockage or buildup. waiting to here back from the mr. coffee customer service  but i am very disappointed the machine appears to only have lasted a couple of months.08/10/2020: i have had this machine for a couple of weeks now and i absolutely love it! i mostly make cappuccinos with a latte every now and then  and it does a really good job extracting the flavor of the coffee from the espresso/coffee grounds (especially for this price point). the automatic milk streaming/frothing apparatus makes it really simple to make delicious drinks  and the removable container is convenient for storing unused milk in the fridge. there’s definitely a bit of a learning curve when it comes to how much espresso to put in the portafilters  and how much tampering is needed. but once you get that down  it delivers pretty consistent drinks.note: you must follow the directions when first setting up the machine and prime it! it may take a few tries for the water to come out of the milk steam pipe during priming  but it will come out eventually. you also should do the clean function after every use (if you’re making several drinks  then clean after you finish making them all). it only takes about 30 seconds for the clean function to run its course  so it’s not really that inconvenient. i usually do it when i’m drinking my cappuccino.
June 26 2020,2.0,1,didn't froth after 3 weeks!,i wanted to like this machine and i really tried  it has been on my to buy lost for the longest and i finally got it. i did the initial clean up receiving as recommended in hopes of getting the best out of the machine for as long as possible. still  three weeks later and the thing refuses to froth milk! it makes all of the sounds as if it's frothing but nothing. the espresso is coming out thick and dark and with a weird taste now. if i do a thorough clean i can probably get a half decent cup out of it  but basically im finding myself having to do a deep clean before each use which is troublesome as im a working mom and my weekday mornings are filled with running around the house getting ready to head out. i simply do not have the time to deep clean before each use. i don't think that's the point of it being automatic anyway. i have tried all recommendations and even googled a few of my own  this thing still barely frothy milk! at 200 bucks a pop you'd think you could get a solid few months out of it before it started to act up. i will be sending this back and shelling out the extra 50 for coffee mates machine prayerfully i'll have better luck. if you have the time to troubleshoot before each cup then by all means go ahead and buy  but if you're like me expecting to push go and have a nice cappuccino at least once a week this isn't the machine for that.
February 9 2017,1.0,15,broke after 3 months,update: it broke after 3 and 1/2 monthsso far so good. it's very simple to use and love it. i read the review saying to run vinegar after priming it but before first use. i skipped that and it was not coming out right  did it and now it's perfect. make sure you tamper it well (30 pounds of pressure). i've played with all settings and it works perfectly! great  rich espressos (and i'm from miami where we drink cuban coffee)  great cappuccinos and lattes  great foam  and great temperature (hot). i'll update in time  but so far so good!
June 20 2019,2.0,2,i wouldn’t purchase it again.,i really dislike this machine.i’ve had it almost 2 months and i’ve given it a fair shake.it’s affordable. it’s not difficult to use.it makes a mid-level tasting espresso  and i grind my beans fresh daily.it does not make consistent lattes or cappuccinos  and this is without changing the settings.  i will make these back to back  and the amount of froth or foam is inconsistent. that is annoying.it’s not the easiest to clean.  you have to remember to clean the upper components after you brew. the frother is somewhat easy  but you still get caked on milk if you are not careful a toothbrush will take care of that.it gets the job done without having to stop for coffee daily.i would not purchase this machine again  however and would opt for something higher quality.if you are looking for super quick and go in the am - this isn’t for you.
February 26 2021,5.0,0,really good coffee machine!,ok  i mainly wanted a machine to be able to froth milk. i looked for a new machine since i got tired of the less expensive ones i already owned which produced froth by a wand steam. they both stopped operating after a while.this coffee machine is superior to both my previous machines both in terms of the quality of both coffee and the froth milk it produces  and in terms of the ease of use. the overall taste of the coffee is smoother  and the froth milk is produced much more effortlessly. parts are detachable to a good degree  and are easily cleaned.my only complain would be the amount of time it takes for a cup of coffee (especially if produced by a single shot) to lose its 'super-hot' temperature. using wand steams  milks were getting pretty hot and would stay like that for a longer time. however  the difference is not that much at all  and it's minor thing subject to individual tastes.totally recommend this machine!
December 22 2021,1.0,2,i keep getting a reused product,i got used product twice.i clearly ordered a new product butfirst product i got; had scratches and a lot of stains or watermark where the coffee goesi started return and ordered a second product in order to get a new product but this time;- bottom of the machine is already filled with water and where coffee goes also seems to have water mark; no noticeable scratches but this is really disappointingim new to coffee so idk but there is no way some barista test these products running water thru them and leaving water in the system where ppl may consume from who the hell knows when;i will return this second purchase as well
October 30 2021,2.0,2,fun coffee machine but impractical for daily use,this machine does make a tasty cappuccino  however it is a lot of work for 1 cup of coffee. it is impractical to make several cups in a morning  and while i really like the automatic frothing feature i'd just assume go back to truwhip. i really wish i could return this (out of my return window) and go to a traditional drip machine. definitely have buyers remorse on this purchase!
