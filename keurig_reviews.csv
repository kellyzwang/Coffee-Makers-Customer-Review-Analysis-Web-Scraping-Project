July 15 2018,5.0,2082,foam issue resolved,my first 4 cups with this brewer were frustrating... 3 cups of steamed milk (no foam) and 1 cup of cold milk (no foam). i felt like i had tried everything... skim milk  almond milk  whole milk... latte setting  cappuccino setting. i was ready to put the thing back in the box and return it because the cost was too high if all it was going to do was make a single serve coffee. my last ditch effort paid off though! i wondered  why did they give me this lid for the frother? maybe it serves a purpose in the process. so i used 2% promised land milk on the cappuccino setting with the lid on the frother. success! it wasn’t just a little foam or thin either. there was a lot of foam and very thick. so  if you’re having issues with foam and you haven’t used the lid  try it! for some reason  it makes all the difference.
July 8 2018,1.0,1568,update.,i am updating my review from 5 stars to 1. used to love this maker until today. it died after only seven months of use.it turns on tries to pump then power turns off.  i tried to unplug to reset. still shuts down. i make 3 cups a day. this machine should last more than 7 months.
August 2 2018,4.0,676,great coffee  latte and cappuccino  but trips gfi circuit breakers,this machine is a great combination for those coffee / cappuccino lovers who want fast  convenient and reliable.  there is one alert  however to plug the machine into its own circuit.  the reason is that it pulls substantial amps and will trip gfi circuit breakers. from my experience  it seems to occur when the auto off engages.  i spoke with keurig whose engineers agreed that it will likely trip your circuit breaker.  you can disable the auto off per the user guide  but i am just turning the machine off after each use.  not as convenient  but a small sacrifice for great coffee  lattes and cappuccinos.
August 5 2018,1.0,659,electrical fault with multiple units,i wish this wasn’t the review i’m writing because i’ve loved my older keurig unit i was planning on replacing  however  after two of these coffee machines  we’ve determined there’s an electrical fault in the units that trip the breakers. i’m not talking about just on gfci/gfi outlets. any outlet in the house gets tripped. super frustrating. beautiful machine  not so great on the function at the moment. i’ll check back once the unit has been proofed.
July 31 2018,5.0,534,but the "strong" option on the machine gives me the next best thing with a dark or espresso roast,i did a bunch of research to find a k-cup compatible machine that also makes lattes/cappuccinos  while offering an "espresso" option.  i know that's a lot  but that's what i wanted! :)  as far an i can see  there is nothing that compares with this machine.  true  it does not make a "legit" espresso  but the "strong" option on the machine gives me the next best thing with a dark or espresso roast.  (the "strong" option can also be used to make a stronger brew of regular coffee.)  the milk frother is wonderful.  my mother is very picky about her latte foam and she was amazed at how good it is. so i bought her this machine for her birthday.  it does all this and it makes lattes/capps in keurig time.  i researched a few other machines that offered similar options  but they brewed coffee at a glacial pace  and i don't have that kind of time to wait in the morning. finally  it is super easy to use (which is also why i bought it for my mom)  and i like that because i'm easily confused before my first cuppa in the morning.  now  i will say that i've only had the machine for about two weeks  so i can't speak to it's longevity.  fingers crossed for that. cheers!
August 28 2018,2.0,407,was awesome for one week and then stopped working,purchased this item on a tuesday. it arrived on a thursday. everything was awesome and then exactly one week from date of purchase it stopped working. it powers on and then instead of brewing it just shuts itself off. i called keurig customer serive  we rebooted it  disabled the auto off feature  tried all sorts of troubleshooting and ultimately they directed me back to amazon. so a replacement is on its way and hopefully this new one doesn't stop working after only a week.for the time that it worked it created perfectly frothed milk for both hot and cold drinks and we brewed coffee with no issue. i am really hoping i just received a "lemon" this first time and it isn't an issue with all of the units.
July 9 2018,5.0,484,makes yummy stuff from chai.  easy to use and it offers lots of variety.  easy to clean.  smart design.,we resisted the k-cup trend for a long time  but the features of this machine won us over.  we are stupidly happy to make this machine our first keurig.• out of the box  it sets up incredibly easy.• install the filter to the water vessel  add water and you're good to go.• you can use any k-cup in this machine.• selecting "coffee"  you are offered four brewing volumes to choose from.  6  8  10 and 12 ounces.• you can also select latte/cappuccino  which results in a strong shot from your pod of choice.• the heated frother is impressive.  i can't believe what it does to 2% lactaid!• brewing times are very efficient and clean-up is very simple.• the water reservoir is easy to handle  refill and reinstall.• it's not overly noisy.• it has a larger footprint than our classic brewer but having the heated frother is worth it.• the design is smartly efficient and very good looking.added 7/21/18:i've added a picture showing the results of frothing a single latte serving of 2% lactaid.  i think you can see the line between the froth and the liquid about half way.  it's amazing.  really  the frother is the point in this model and it makes all kinds of things possible.we purchased this variety pack and recommend it highly as the perfect way to sample a wide variety of the cups that are popular here on amazon.
August 13 2018,5.0,311,just what i needed,this is just what i needed! i only drink a cup of coffee a day - it’s usually a latte or mocha. i got the my k cup universal filter  i use my favorite starbucks coffee and i get 2 espresso shots per use. the milk foamer is perfect - i’ve used half/half  heavy whipping cream  and almond milk - so far no issues with that. i get nice foam with all 3. totally worth what i paid for it - in the long run i will save money and this machine will have paid for itself!
September 16 2018,5.0,280,this thing is amazing!,my darling bride and i lived in italy for two years (i know  rough life) and really became connoisseurs of fine café. while the k-cafe is not "real" espresso  it's a phenomenal substitute.the frother is astonishing! i'm still not entirely sure how that little booger works: but within a minute  half & half in a room temperature frothing mug is the consistency of shaving cream. just fill it to the appropriate line  put the lid on and hit the button. done. start that  get to the coffee side and everything will be done at about the same time.there's a setting for coffee or latte/capo. by selecting the latte/capo button  the machine automatically selects "strong" and "shot". it knows what you want and sets it up for you. for cappuccino  i use two shots of black rifle ak espresso or their death punch. and for a keurig  this is as close to the real deal as you're going to get without an authentic  steam-injected machine. and i might be awake for three days!for regular coffee  you will want to experiment with the various sizes and strengths to get the perfect cup for you. the darling bride fancies two pods of french roast  8 ounces each  for her favorite morning jump start. i'm not a big coffee fan anymore (i sort of coffeed out in the navy)  but when i want a good hearty espresso or cappuccino  it doesn't get much better - or easier - than this. we're glad we retired our old keurig and got this  and we highly recommend it without reservation!
October 12 2018,3.0,148,love machine has a design weakness though,we have had our machine for one week and love it!  the frother works very well and makes lots of creamy froth.  there is one weakness in the machine. the handle on the water tank is held on by a small solid plastic pin.  the first time we filled the reservoir with water and lifted it by the handle the pin snapped and the handle broke. we paid keurig $29.95 for a replacement.  we could have avoided the fee by returning the item to amazon but frankly it would have cost us more in time than the cost of a replacement water bin.  we were really disappointed that keurig required us to pay for a replacement when the machine was new.  we hope the designers will fix the handle design in the next generation of the machine.
October 12 2018,1.0,136,big waste of money,i think this is a big waste of money. i looked a lot for a cappuccino machine and read lots of reviews and i think the vídeo they put with the pictures of this machine are misleading. they don’t show the frother working beginning to end. the frother its a joke!. i used coffee creamer and it didn’t do any foam at all. then i used milk and this is as much “foam” i got for my “cappuccino”.i was really excited for my very 1st keurig and this is a total disappointment.
December 5 2018,3.0,86,love/hate relationship:1st unit defective.less tech.watch out 4 frother glitch during auto/off cycle,update #2 (12.26.18): i'm very leery to post this updated review based on my unit going defective when i posted original review below. hopefully no jinxing this time. so i called amazon who connected me through keurig manufacturers of this machine  and i was able to get it replaced. i might add how really frustrating that process was  but amazon stayed connected for duration of the call which was nice. took 20 minutes for the k-rep to get my email address correct  and about another 15 for my address; clearly they are based outside the us if you need to spell illinois five times. then you have to wait almost a week to get an email to print the fedex label to ship out. k-rep instructed me to leave on porch and someone would get it in a few days  but how would they know when i got/printed label? since that didn't sit well i called fedex and was another daunting experience in itself (i'll spare you the details).in the end i got my replacement unit but was not the correct color (k-rep never asked  and i was so frustrated in the 50 minute phone call that i forgot to inquire). i was instead sent the "special edition" and i was like  wow free upgrade. sadly still low tech  no extra features. i must admit i like this special edition better. the only difference is the color and a couple finishes. it's more metallic looking and goes better with my ss appliances. the drip tray cover and handle to brewer are metal and appearance is nicer so it doesn't have the cheap look as the black did. bear in mind i didn't think that of the black model at the time until i can now compare the two. i hated the drip tray on the black model  cover never seated right; had to mess with it a few times every time you clean it to seat properly (not with special edition). i've now had my replacement for two weeks (1 week longer than previous machine that crapped out after 5 days). i am pleased to report no electrical issues or draining of my tank. i bumped this review up to three stars  cause i dont think i'm out of the woods yet. i still cringe everytime i turn machine on  is it going to break? i'll provide another update 6-12 months and give 5 stars if still no further issues.update # 1: i was in bed late writing 5 star review below  now one star. irony is literally hours later when i woke up  i turned power on for first time after posting review  and drained my tank. unit is defective... just drains tells you to add water and kept on draining. see video. silver lining/bonus to no auto on feature... the tank was full  and would of emptied out all over the counter and floor so it could have been worse.original review: more money on this unit for less tech. power button/auto off that's it folks. no fancy clock  no auto on to a preset time  and the addition of water tank handle is annoying! interferes with the lid operation. cash in the chips and trade all that tech for some latte's and capps! is it worth it  you bet! had the lattes and caps not turn out so well i would of been furious to back pedal from the elite version. i have had no breaker issues at all *sigh relief*helpful tip: when auto off is engaged  (power off cycle) it is possible for the unit to provide false feedback from frother during auto off cycle fooling one to think it can operate and fool you again to believe its broke. for reasons unclear you can press cold  latte  or capp buttons on frother and they beep/ light up on frother  but milk wont churn. once i realized auto off engaged  i turned power to keurig on  and it was fine. weird glitch..... again  power to frother comes on and can press capp or latte and seems responsive  but didn't froth or do anything.. come to find out the power to keurig must be on or you will have froth issues. my only question is why did they design it this way? if power is off to keurig machine  there should be no power to frother  fooling one to think its broke since it is reactive minus the froth process.
June 14 2018,5.0,129,amazing machine,i am already is love with this machine. it makes an amazing latte. i have been waiting for keurig to come out with one. we have an espresso machine but we never use it cause it was such a pain to make anything with it. making a latte is so easy and clean up is a breeze with this new machine. makes great regular coffee just like you expect with a keurig machine. only thing i would change is a feature that allows you to have it turn on at a preset time. it does take a little longer to heat up compared to our older keurig model.
August 23 2018,1.0,97,frother doesn't work,i'm on my second k-cafe  i had to return the first because the brother quit working...i got the new one and the brother has never worked....on the first one  the brother worked for about three weeks before it quit  and it was a truly glorious coffee maker. i was so happy with it! now i'm just annoyed. i guess i will return it for another and hope that third times the charm??
November 17 2018,5.0,53,keurig really landed this one!,i've had this machine for about a week now and love it!the bad:1)  the "safe" level to fill the milk to is not even 12 oz  but you can overfill it a little.  after done frothing pour it right away!  the foam separates out quicker than when steamed traditionally.2)  the water reservoir handle is poorly positioned.  you use the handle to pull it from the machine  but then you can't remove the lid to fill it unless you set it down again as the up position of the handle doesn't allow the lid to come off.  oops!the good:1)  you can pull your coffee and froth milk at the same time.  it does need to heat up completely before it will do both.  you'll know because you press the button to froth and it won't do anything.  just be patient and it'll start frothing when the machine is ready.2)  it seems hotter than other keurigs  but doesn't seem to take any longer to heat up and it does heat up quickly.3)  i read some reviews about it popping breakers  etc.  i have a "normal" home as for electrical wiring (none of my outlets pop) and it's fine.4)  coupon for 50% off through keurig website!  i can't remember if that came in the box or i got it after i registered my keurig  but i ordered 5 boxes of starbucks  (24 cups/bx) and paid less than $50.5)  not as big a footprint as i thought.overall  really nice machine and i'd recommend to anyone!
January 23 2019,5.0,51,an easy-to-use brewer that makes great-tasting espresso-style beverages,i love this brewer!  i hesitated to buy it because the only experience i have with espresso beverages was ordering them at starbucks—but after all  i reasoned  this is a keurig  so it can’t be too complicated to use.  and it’s not complicated at all!  i was up and running with my first mocha latte inside of 10 minutes  it’s that simple!  it uses ordinary k-cups  whatever flavor you choose (i like starbucks plus  which claims to have twice the normal caffeine) and whatever milk you like  whole  soy  low-fat  etc.  for mocha  i’m using low-fat chocolate milk  but that’s just me—the rules are  there aren’t any rules!  oh  there is one rule:  be sure to clean the frothing container  including the magnetic stirrer which sits on a spindle in the bottom of the frother.  of course  this is not a genuine espresso machine  those sell for $1 000 or more  but for me  it’s plenty good enough!
July 22 2019,1.0,43,buy the smaller ones - stagnant k-cup blend,here is the huge flaw in this design. there is an external reservoir  nbd right? wrong! first this thing costs a fortune. why did i get this one? to avoid buyer's remorse. ironically here i am full of regret and out 200 dollars. so why am i so disappointed? this unit has an internal reservoir in addition to the external. so what happens is the unit sucks water in to make your k-cup  but instead of just using it straight from the reservoir it pulls it into the internal reservoir for the next batch. basically what this thing does is if you drink 1 cup a day  you're using water that's just been sitting stagnant inside the machine to brew your cup. the only way to get fresh water is to cycle the machine once before you use it. if you use filtered water you're just throwing money down the drain  as well as extending the time and effort it takes to make your cup. this thing sucks! you want one  buy mine i'd gladly sell it to you to get the smallest one. perhaps for an office or something this could work  but you're always forced to used old water that's been sitting in the machine. absolutely not a good fit for an occasional k-cup.
November 9 2018,1.0,65,caveat emptor,this was great for about a week. then it just stopped. it started making a noise like it wanted to warm up and then click. it was off. just stopped. out of frustration and having lost a spendy new keurig  i threw it away. who saves the box?  no refund  exchange or credit for this mt mama.
August 27 2018,5.0,59,works great. easy to use. easy to clean. looks stylish.,replaced our existing keurig with the keurig cafe and it is awesome!  haven’t made coffee yet but we have run water through to clean and tried out the frother. wow!  can’t wait until morning!update:  check out the cappuccino!  easy to use - great foam  a dream machine.
June 23 2018,5.0,77,espresso beverages are superb  and makes great drip coffee as well!,surprisingly awesome!  i was very skeptical because i like espresso beverages.  i bought this to replace a 15 year old  well loved krups machine that had auto drip on the left and espresso on the right since i husband prefers drip.  he also loves his keurig machine at work.  this machine was not bigger than my krups dual purpose machine  so i didn't think the footprint was too big.  first beverage i made was an iced latte.  it was perfect!  it even frothed the coffeemate sweet italian cream non-dairy creamer which my krups machine was never able to do.  now  if the machine can last 15 years like my krups i will be very happy  but that has yet to be seen.  i like it very much  it is very easy to use  and has simple instructions.update: still works great! i can get 2 shots out of 1 k-cup without compromising the quality of the beverage.  to me  frothing works better for lattes on both and cold and hot settings  but cappuccino frothing is decent.  tray is removablel  and as long as your travel mug isn't taller than 7" it will fit under the brewer.
September 21 2018,5.0,45,this is wonderful!!!,our krups latte machine we had for over 25 years finally quit working.  we nursed it along as things aged and broke.  we looked online for quite a while until we found the k-cafe and decided to give it a try.  well  it is just wonderful.  we love it.  easy to use  and have found the close to perfect match for the lattes we used to make on our krups: do the latte milk in the frother  select coffee  strong  8 oz. and use your own keurig "my k-cup" and fill it within 1/8 inch of the top.  we are used to the krups double shot  so this is the closest we can get.  only suggestion would be for keurig to add a "double shot" option/capability.  otherwise  if possible  we would give this 8 stars!!  :)
March 23 2019,1.0,40,buyer beware-,to start off bought two of these machines...both didn’t work. here’s my rating.1.do not buy if you have a brand new home or recently rewired your kitchen with the newest gsi wiring/plugin outlets. this machine is a powerhog  it will brew the espresso/coffee just fine  but once the milk frothing begins it exceeds the two minute mark then blows every fuse in the kitchen. thus you’ll have to go to your fuse box to retrip it...let me mention the coffee maker was the only thing plugged in at the time of brewing and i tried every outlet thinking it was our wiring that caused the blowouts. read other reviews and found they had the same problem. very annoying.2. it has two milk frothing options cappuccino or latte. this is a complete joke  it’s literally two bottons doing the same thing. the only difference is the amount of milk you put in the milk pitcher. both have the same froth consistency which is overly frothed milk.3. neat design and color choice of coffee maker  but quite large compared to other coffee makers.4. the strong button is nice to make your coffee taste stronger5. cold frother option was a cool concept6. temperature control was good  the drinks always came out hot... but by the time of retripping my fuse box and getting the power hog to work again  you could say my cup of joe wasn’t so satisfactory.i thought kerig would’ve had these kinks straightened out before selling a coffee machine poorly as this one :/
April 2 2019,4.0,32,very convenient and easy,i have had this coffee maker now for 4 months. it worked flawlessly until 2 days ago when the frother stopped frothing. it still spins but the milk only gets hot. after a closer inspection it appears that the small post that causes the magnet to spin has a hairline crack through the plastic housing where it is seated.in addition it looks like the crack is being caused by an upward force as there is a slight bulge in the spot as if the post is being pushed out of the machine. so clearly not something we could have done. i'm not sure why this would cause the frother to stop working. perhaps it no longer spins fast enough. in any case i got in touch with keurig directly and they were very supportive making arrangements to have this corrected within a few days. i still believe the machine is the best for our needs so looking forward to having it up and running again. hopefully the service keurig provides backs up our belief in our coffee maker.
October 14 2018,1.0,52,turns off randomly  and pours water out the spout when turned back on.,delivered aug 17  2018. randomly turns off. first time it happened it started pouring water out and burned me! i have only had the product for less than 2 months. problems started a little over a month  and was too late to return.
November 22 2018,1.0,34,not worth it,i got this to replace an older model. as usual  it's very practical but don't expect great coffee out of it. i personally had issues with this new one and now unfortunately is past amazon's limit for returns so i will have to stick to it. sometimes it acts up and i have to power cycle it. the milk frother does an ok job also but i had another issue: it showed rust with just a month of use. i noticed it can accumulate water underneath - a big design flaw imo.i like to use my own coffee in the universal cup and on this one it always leaks out of it.as i said i regret the purchase and my timing with a decision to return it.
July 11 2018,5.0,45,aaaaaaaaamazing!,this coffee machine is going to save me loads of money!  i’m a big fan of americanos with steamed breve....use to order two everyday at the local coffee shop..not anymore!  this machine makes them better!
August 20 2018,5.0,30,starbucks barista approved,as a former starbucks barista and self diagnosed coffee addict this machine is a dream come true. unlike other low budge coffee makers this machine does a great drop both heating and frothing the milk. i had given up on making lattes at home long ago after machines that were in my priced range water down the milk in a poor effort to heat and froth during the steaming process. i definitely wasn’t going to buy one of those $1000+ machines either. i’m not sure how it heats the milk but it does a perfect job and the foam is impressive.the machine is fun  easy to use and intuitive. i didn’t even open the instruction manual. the lattes and cappuccinos it makes are comparable to starbucks using any kpod you desire. i’ve tried several non-espresso roast kpods and had delicious latte regardless of which one i used. this is one of my few splurges that i didn’t need but was definitely worth the money!!!
July 3 2018,5.0,35,this machine is amazing  could almost cry over how fantastic it is,i plan on making a more thorough review video soon  editing it now. this machine is amazing  could almost cry over how fantastic it is. trust me when i tell you that your spending your money on some convenient high grade equipment here and my life could not have been more complete without it.
October 16 2018,4.0,25,keurig k-cafe v. nespresso,i had a keurig from almost the time they first came out.  a couple of years ago  i switched to a nespresso machine.  however  i did not enjoy the high price of non-reusable nespresso cups and all the reusable ones were challenging with no less work.  so  when the k-cafe came out  i thought it was the answer to my needs.  here are my personal pros and cons:k-cafe allows you to use reusable k-cup with your own coffee which i love.  this is a considerable cost saving and allows me infinite flavor and strength options.  4 shipments of nespresso pods equaled the cost of the entire k-cafe machine.  the k-cafe has a larger water reservoir and has multiple size/portion settings  the built in frother is dishwasher safe and works very well (although i read some reviews that it didn't - i've had no issues).  importantly  it is easy to clean and is a fast as my nespresso frother.  unlike my nespresso frother  the k-cafe frother will froth cold milk very well and does not leave a "skin" at the bottom of the frother like my nespresso frother did when frothing hot.  the two biggest draw-backs are:  the frother part is plastic - and am worried that if broken or lost  will cause an issue.  importantly   "no crema" for the k-cafe "shot."  because of this  i've not been able to get a nice creamy strong shot.  i'll be playing with the grind  but i believe it is more a function of a lack of the pressure that the nespresso has.  so  in short  if you are a "kitchen barista" like me who likes lots of variety  the k-cafe will more than meet all your coffee  tea  hot chocolate  and specialty needs.  however  if you are an espresso aficionado  you will be disappointed in the lack of pure crema.
July 27 2018,3.0,41,frother not frothing,the frother quit frothing and now just warms the milk. called customer service and did not get any answers. they said they would call back next week. really keurig?
July 16 2019,1.0,21,frother breaks down after return period is over. keurig does not respond on website,i purchased this product and was delighted with the performance for the 1st few weeks.  one day about 6 weeks after i purchased the machine  the frother simply stopped working.  after checking all the boards and what on-line info i could  i went to the keurig website and asked how to fix it.  they responded that they respond to all requests within 48 hours and sent me a nice note that asked that i watch the video's or call for service.  i am past the amazon return window and will now have to devote time to work through the issue with them.i purchase very  very frequently on amazon and have never been faced with this issue before.i strongly recommend that you not buy this particular model machine because neither amazon nor keurig offer the support they should for a piece of equipment at this price point.
July 19 2018,5.0,34,phenomenal coffee and latte / cap maker,omg!  this k-cafe is the bomb!  i am so thrilled to be making all the fancy  expensive drinks at home now!  i researched this model for some time as i didn’t want to buy a $1 000 + model from italy and this seemed just perfect for hubby and i (i like caps and lattes and he likes a good ol’cuppa joe).  so i finally decided to try it & received my k-cafe yesterday.  super easy set up and directions were short  simple and clear.  made my first cap this morning.  i used a decaf peet’s k-cup for my shot and since i only had half and half in the fridge  used that.  omg!  it took me less than 5 minutes to make my cap (and that was while reading the directions while i made it) and the volume of foam on the milk was incredible!  more than i’ve ever had at a custom or indie coffee shop.  of course that had a lot to do with the fat in the half and half but darn  that frother works really well.  i can’t wait to see how whole milk and almond milk turn out.  i also love how easy it is to rinse out the little frother pot  too for use the next time.  bottom line for me and my family  this k-cafe rocks and i’ll be saving so much money and time from now on.  thank you keurig!  you made the perfect machine for us here!  p.s. i bought this k-cafe with my own money and no one paid me to write this review.  😊update!  i’ve had this for about a week now and have used soy milk  almond milk  cashew milk  whole milk and 2% milk (allorganic).  the froth is still thick and plenty of it and hot!  😍  hubby  who just likes regular cups of coffee even enjoys all the 6  8  10 and 12 oz options for coffee  too (and he thought we didn’t need this machine)!  if i could give this 6 stars  i would!
July 21 2018,1.0,87,frother frustrations :(,i'm already on my 2nd machine because the frother does not work.  there is clearly a defect that needs to be addressed.  my first machine worked for about 10 days and then stopped  the frother on the second machine never worked.  the machine will heat the milk but cannot create the froth which makes having a latte or cappuccino impossible.  don't buy this machine until keurig figures out the issues with the frother.  if that worked  i'd highly recommend it.
August 28 2018,4.0,25,good cappacino,i have figured out how to make a good cup...strong and good foam.  i do 2 shots from same pod or reusable cup... then use full milk with a dash of half and half...then do a cold whip then a hot whip of same milk...this gives you a full  more solid and lasting foam.  i am still looking for an espresso that i really like.  so far  the reusable cup gives me a stronger espresso flavor when doing 2 shots.  my only regret with the machine is that it is not real expresso but i knew that when i first ordered it.  am satisfied.
March 28 2019,1.0,22,don't buy this model it has electrical issues - see other reviews that mention the same,i bought this coffee machine and really liked it unit it started tripping the breakers in our kitchen.  our kitchen has new wiring and breakers and i have run many other devices like other coffee makers  microwaves  electric skillet  etc. with no issues.  other reviewers have mentioned this same breaker tripping problem.  it used to only happen when the auto shut off was engaged but now it happens more frequently.  i wish i would have returned it before the thirty day window closed on returns.  do yourself a favor and buy a different model.  keurig knows about the issue but continues to sell a faulty product.
October 29 2018,1.0,32,weak coffee,was excited to receive this machine today and was disappointed with the first cup of coffee.  it tastes like water and a smidge of coffee.  2nd cup tried the strong and 8oz size and still weak.  tried strong and 6oz and still tastes like water.  my old keurig brewed much better coffee.  trying the espresso pods tomorrow - if still weak then i am sending back.
April 24 2019,3.0,14,worst customer service. dont purchase.,after having this for only 2 months. the frother stopped working. the automatic shut off stopped working as well. called amazon who i understand doesn't service the product transfer me to keurig representative who was rude and clearing not in the mood to help transferred me again to another representative who was just as rude. actually  even worse. didn't care about my concerns when i asked if they could ship replacement faster. she stated it's free  that all we cover. the express you have to pay. proceeded by cutting me off when i was attempting to say i would pay. wow talk about horrible customer service. they both said it was a new product that has issues so in other words they were trying to say hey  deal with it. do yourself a favor dont purchase until they have their issues worked out. will never be purchasing any of their products again.
December 4 2019,3.0,9,overrated on amazon  but not a total pos,if you had keurig machines before  this machine won't blow you away.  i paid a cyber monday price for it so i am willing to cut it some slack.  if i had paid full price i would have sent it back. i have owned four keurig machines in the past and this machine is very much a basic  entry-level keurig machine with an attached milk frother.  by entry-level  i am referring that it does not have a programmable timer or programmable off-switch.  it doesn't have water temperature controls like other keurig in its price range.  the temperature of the brewing water cannot be set between 186-192f like other keurigs.  it's pretty lightweight compared to previous models so not sure what that might imply about the build quality.the milk frother is essentially and literally a magnetic spinning cogwheel that whips up the milk inside the milk frother cup.  the stainless steel cup has a coupling mechanism on the bottom that attaches to a spinning motor in the housing of the coffee maker.  the cogwheel is held in place by magnetism  but not a very strong magnet.  so when washing out the steel cup  make sure the cogwheel doesn't fall lose and go down your kitchen drain otherwise you will be without a milk frother.  how long the mechanism frothers the milk isn't adjustable which would explain why many people might have different degrees of luck frothing milk.what i do like about the machine is that it saves you some time by dropping in a k-cup and some creamer  pressing a few buttons and walking away while it makes your coffee.  and it may take a while because unlike other keurig machines i have own  this one takes its time heating up the pump.  if you already have a medium-end keurig machine  you don't need this.  just get yourself an aa-battery powered spinning milk frother and a steel milk frothing cup and you will have your cup of coffee sooner than this gadget will make it for you.it is compatible with reusable k-cups for loose coffee grains.  the mechanism for inserting k-cups is exactly the same as found on first-gen keurig machines so those attachments should work fine with this machine.if i could turn back the clock  i would have not ordered it since i already had a programmable keurig machine with lcd display and the milk frother on this machine is a joke for any serious cappuccino and latte drinker.**** edit 3 hours later.this keurig model does not even have a water filter holder like every other keurig before it.  the milk frother does not even warm up the milk or cream.  on closer inspection  the spinning cogwheel spins based on changing magnetic polarities which means this thing will be prone to get stuck.  i am really disappointed with keurig.  i will be returning this back to them after all.  my old keurig was much better.  if you paid more than a hundred dollars  you overpaid for this machine.
December 1 2018,1.0,23,let's start here...,i've had a single serve keurig for years and finally pulled the trigger on a cappuccino maker. when i unboxed my new keurig i was very disappointed.... it just looks cheap! my old keurig has a very classy look with a metal cup plate  silver accents and feels very solid. the cappuccino keurig just looks and feels of cheap plastic! everything is plastic excluding the frother. not at all what i expected.
September 12 2018,4.0,20,love at first cup!,always loved cappuccino but never wanted all the extra equipment and mess of a esp/capp machine.  this keurig does it all (regular coffee too) and my first capp was done easily with a decaf italian pod.  delicious!i am only giving four stars because the tank is a little small  but more importantly  i am pretty sure that the tiny little frother valve will go down my garbage disposal while cleaning within the first week! (a design improvement could be helpful on that). otherwise i am in love!
March 13 2019,2.0,15,great concept  unfortunately not a good coffee maker,pros: nice design and looks good on the counter. but that's it.cons: takes a long time to brew. heats up for 2 minutes before starting the coffee.  the coffee itself is hot  but always tastes watered down. not even fresh. even when you press the "strong" brew button.milk frother is a joke. doesnt froth the milk at all...just adds a few bubbles  for both the cold and hot option.overall i'm disappointed  it was a total waste of money and i dont recommend it.if you want a good and easy to care for milk frother i recommend the one from nespresso.
November 15 2018,1.0,21,stay away! failed twice,update: this thing is trash. they sent a replacement  it does the same thing again within 10 days. props for this one lasting 3 more days than the last one.  do not buy thisworked great for 5 days.  now it shuts off anytime you start the brew.  replacement is arriving today  hopefully it doesn't do the same thing.  while it was working  my wife loved it.  frother works well  was quieter than her old single serve keurig machine.  there are a lot of reports of this machine having this same issue.  when it works  well worth it.  make sure you get the extra protection plan  just in case
December 24 2018,2.0,15,it cannot handle pressure,yes  this is the review that quotes billy joel.this thing worked fine for a while  but it has developed the nasty habit of forcing so much pressure into the k-cups at the end of its cycle that the top of the k-cup spits open  sending grinds and water all over the counter.no amount of cleaning  poking paper clips through holes  etc fixes this problem. occasionally it helps to poke an extra hole in the bottom of the k-cup to avoid this issue.so whatever happened to craftsmanship? why is my life littered with expensive keurig and apple products that are  from drafting table to assembly line  just thrown together? seems to me it is time for enterprising individuals to rediscover the joy of constant improvement; how an appreciation for excellence can provide life with the sort of satisfaction stock prices can't buy.maybe it's our fault. we enjoy the convenience of these silly online stores and lose our ability to discriminate in the process.
November 11 2020,1.0,7,a neat machine that broke within a year and the company does not stand by product,what a ridiculous waste of money. i like the keurig brewers for a fast and fun cup of coffee. it did what i was expecting in being able to make an imitation latte or cappuccino or just be used as a regular keurig. but then the milk frother started beeping randomly all times of day and stopped working. i searched online and it's a common problem/defect. nothing fixes it. i called keurig and they denied it being a known issue  wouldn't warranty the product  and simply offered to discount a new machine! 7 months! $200! this is absurd for a reputable company. if you take the risk with this machine  get a warranty... what a waste of money.
September 22 2019,4.0,8,there is a trick to making the frother always work,i read the reviews...…….. was really worried about getting a machine that had a defective frother.  i bought the machine anyways  because i really wanted one with a frother.  the coffee taste amazing  the "shot" function produces the closest thing to an espresso shot without actually having an espresso machine.  although i do recommend buying a darker roast coffee pod as opposed to a light or medium blend if that is what you are going for.  the machine also makes a "strong" cup of coffee when using the strong button.  the latte's and the capp's are really very well crafted considering i am using a keurig and not going to a coffee shop.  i have not tried the cold function yet.  now  the big thing that everyone complains about ………….. the frother not working.  as someone mentioned   it does help to have the lid on  but it is actually the small black wheel inside the milk container that has the issues.  i am not a engineer ( i am a nurse) so forgive my laymen terms on this matter.  the wheel seems to be activated by some sort of magnet  the movement of the small wheel is what makes the milk frothy.  mine did not work right...………… was going to send it back   but really loved the machine and the amount of water the tank held  so i was determined to make it work.  step 1  ------ put in your milk   do not overfill.  setp -2 --------- place the metal cup in it's spot.  step 3------------------ turn on your latte or capp button and then take a tooth pick or a wooden skewer and just flick the wheel to make it start spinning                  put the lid on and wait for your warm frothy milk to be done.  it's one extra step  and yes it should just work like it is supposed to right out of the box and keurig needs to fix the problem if they want to keep selling these machines                           but honestly   one little flick that takes a second to do   is all it takes and i love the coffee   so i will keep it !!!!  i really hope this helps some of the people who are having trouble so they too can enjoy a latte without frustration.  i was not paid for this review  nor did i receive any discounts or promotions...…….. i just hate to see people missing out on a good cup of coffee  :)  i deducted one star because really it should just work  without the extra step.
October 22 2021,1.0,3,decent enough coffee  but unreliable machine,this machine  to be clear  is just a regular keurig brewer with an included milk frother. it is not an espresso machine  and you will not get beverages resembling coffee-house drinks no matter what the buttons say  or how it is marketed. i feel a little duped because i thought this machine would produce a beverage similar to a latte  but it's just regular coffee and frothy milk. if you already are satisfied with keurig coffees and aren't looking for a latte/espresso maker  chose a different brewer than this one  because it does not do the job it is marketed to do very well at all.further  after a few months of owning it  it started making unreliable cup sizes. it doesn't seem to matter which button i push  because it makes whatever it feels like making. 12 oz comes out as 6 or 8. 8 oz comes out as 4 or 6  unless it decides to make 8 after i've double-brewed to get a full cup and it spills over. yes  i've descaled it several times. in addition  the button that is supposed to make a stronger cup also only works when it is in the mood which isn't often. the frother works just fine  but i don't really want a latte made with regular coffee and lots of milk - it is watery and dull. you are better off buying a cheaper machine  and adding on a separate milk frother if you like watery lattes. buy a nespresso if you actually want a coffehouse style latte. it costs less and makes a superior product. the pods are more (about a dollar each vs as low as about 33 cents each for k-cups)  but they are also a lot more comparable to what you get in a coffee shop for $4.50.
March 5 2019,1.0,12,water leaking issue,we bought this product in october 2018. it’s now march 2019 and it’s nothing but a paperweight.to start...it worked great for the first two months. then  when we turned it on  water would start streaming out of the unit from the k-cup area until we turned it off. if you let it run  it would empty out the entire tank of water unless it was turned off. we turned it off and back on which resolved the issue.about a week ago  the same thing occurred. we tried turning off the unit to reset it but it didn’t work. every time we turn the unit on now  it just streams water out until the tank is empty. it’s not even usable at this point and more importantly this is a huge fire hazard.we tried to return it but it’s beyond the return date.so  we bought a cappuccino machine which lasted roughly 5 months for $180. don’t waste your money.***update***i contacted keurig and amazon after writing this review. amazon was more than happy to send one out immediately with no issues. keurig took over 24 hours to get back to me since they were busy at the time. however  they were happy to send us another keurig. i had to tell them that amazon had already sent another unit out.so  again  like always  amazon helped us and didn’t give us any grief or trouble with the unit. this is the sole reason why we shop with amazon.i will check back and update the review after a few months to see if this unit doesn’t break.april 30  2019still working without any issues. it’s a good unit but if you’re looking for just cappuccino  just get a regular keurig machine. the frothing foam is cool but we found ourselves using just the k cups of cappuccino with a splash of milk.
June 5 2019,1.0,10,junk,this worked great for a week. then the frothier stopped frothing. the little whisk still turns and everything seems to be functioning normally. but the thick foam it produced at first is gone. it heats the milk and produces a very stingy amount of froth on either the cappuccino or latte setting. the keurig website was no help  so i set up an account and contacted customer services. they refused  twice  to just send me troubleshooting directions over email. i had a call a number. so i called the number. and had to set up an account again before they could give me the insightful advice  “try a different milk.” i’m using the same milk i started with. it’s fresh. there isn’t a thing wrong with the milk. the frother just doesn’t work properly.so now i’m stuck with this massive piece of junk on my counter that is twice the size of a coffeemaker and only makes coffee. i can’t send the unit back because after a week  i threw the box away. what a waste. i will never give this company a dime of my money again.
November 10 2018,5.0,15,best keurig i’ve owned—easy to clean,i’ve owned several keurig since i like to make small amounts of coffee. this one is the best ever. the usual features with a larger reservoir (good!). the cappuccino/latte feature works beautifully and clean-up is really easy. the milk cup cleans. no mess. the small piece that froths is magnetic thus not easy to lose. it still fits on our counter. a bit wider than its predecessor. it’s made about 100 cups of coffee & latte.
November 30 2018,1.0,17,major electrical issues,read all the reviews they are all correct !! i plugged it in and immediately it blew my outlet and entire circuit breaker. i was shocked but then again i read the reviews and it was common. it was so bad we needed an electrician . we did learn turning off auto feature helps and ran it once with no issues. the one time we ran it it was awesome lol but not sure i’ll be keeping due to major electrical issues. side not my milk frothed great !
November 5 2018,1.0,26,donot buy from this seller.,my machine just keep bringing water outside when i press on button
December 5 2018,3.0,15,all the non-dairy drinkers out there!,i just bought this on cyber monday and was so disappointed when the frother refused to froth any of the non-dairy milks i tried. i called customer service (keurig’s) today and they’re sending me a new frother  but told me that silk brand anything just won’t froth. i had tried both kroger brand soy milk (simple truth organic) and silk almond milk. customer service told me to use as fresh as possible milk and to avoid silk and almond milk altogether. finally  i tried so delicious’s coconut creamer and it actually foamed! success! so even though it says to use low-fat milk  in my experience  the fuller-fat non-dairys work way better. good luck!
June 6 2020,5.0,5,pays for itself within a month!,i use to visit starbucks at least once per day (sometimes twice)  5-7 days a week.  at $6 per drink  i was spending $42 each week ($2 184/year) just for coffee.  my hubs would visit the coffee shop three times per week  which meant that he was spending $18/week ($936/year).  together  our yearly budget to feed our caffeine addictions was a minimum of $3 120.  ouch!  we agreed that giving up our daily lattes  caps  and fraps was not an option so we went on the hunt for a coffee maker that could meet our caffeine as well as our budget requirements.  this keurig does both!  like the other four keurigs i have bought in the past  it makes a great tasting single cup of coffee quickly.  but the reason i am so impressed with this coffee maker is the frother!  i generally use organic horizon 2% milk and the froth is not only thick and delicious but it doesn't fall flat within just a few minutes like froth that i have made with other frothing devices.  it does not matter if i use full-fat milk  low fat/non-fat milk  2% milk  coconut milk  soy milk  or almond milk--the froth always turns out perfectly.  i buy flavored creamer and flavored syrups from starbucks.  now that i have this keurig  i am a fantastic barista!  my daily visits to the starbucks drive-thru are in my rearview mirror.  the amount of money we save by making all of our coffee at home meant that the keurig paid for itself within three weeks.  we have had this keurig for a year and it still works perfectly. and the balance of our savings account just keeps going up and up! i ended up buying one for my office and my hubby's office as well  saving us even more money!  highly recommend--5 stars!
June 11 2019,5.0,8,i love this new keurig,we recommend the best kitchen review on you tube of this machine..just got this last night and i have already tried all the modes so i may be up very late tonight. we have had a keurig for a long time and the heating mechanism and pump died after 8-10 years. replaced it with this. what a delight. goodbye starbucks. the foamer is the best thing on this machine. i have tried both sizes of hot and cold foam. even tried foaming store bought flavored creamer although that was only moderately successful. for a flavored cold latte  my best suggestion is to add a teaspoon of creamer to the espresso shot. pour over ice. use the cold foam latte setting and pour it into the glass. a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar  vanilla sugar or even some chocolate or caramel syrup drizzle on it is bliss. we bought this one because it was the only one that i saw that had cold foam.  the only thing my husband misses is the screen & the auto-on. however  this heats up so much faster than our old one that the ready to brew screen isn't a big deal. more importantly  it still has the auto-off function.
August 1 2018,5.0,11,best ever.. use it daily. not disappointed at all,i want to take some time to share my experience specific to some of the “cons” that others listed.first the concept is fantastic. it will  brew a single cup in 6 8 10 12 oz both regular and strong brew.it will brew a “shot” of espresso for you to make a cappuccino or latte.the machine has an integrated milk frother. there was a review that stated the frother did not foam the milk. based on that review i had already purchased a (green logo brand) frother for 60.00 while i debated the purchase of this “all in one unit”. should have never done that. the keurig milk frother actually froths better than the (ehem) “other “ brand.i use whole and 2% cold from the fridge.  there is no steam involved in the milk process. just pour into the provided metal cup  set on the base  press the choice of hot (latte  cappuccino) or cold. yes it does both and the hot is to perfect temperature.the water resivoir is  generous and has a “carry handle” that makes detaching and filling easy.one review reports it is “flimsy”. i don’t find it to be. it has a smaller footprint in height than a regular keurig and is wider due to the frother.  i expect the item may have been manufactured with “less plastic” but i do not feel that compromised the quality of the structure.i use this daily and it is my “spoil me” item. i make a mean morning latte with or without flavored syrup and am sure this machine has already paid for itself in my (green logo) lattes i am no longer buying.
April 18 2021,3.0,2,good coffee maker  but nothing else.,i bought the machine in 2019 and it still is working well for my household to make coffee.  so it does make a good hot cup of coffee  but not at the correct temperature.  the first cup is only 165f and by the time you add your cream and sit down to drink it’s lukewarm.  after the 3rd cup it’s up to 180 which isn’t 185 but good enough.  first cup of the day can take up to 2 minutes to brew but all other cups are about 15 seconds.the frother has never worked.  frankly i’m not sure how it should function ever.  the post is solid metal (male side) and the cup has a female solid metal side that fits over the post; neither pice of metal moves  not even by hand.  there’s a little plastic ring that looks like a watch gear (except plastic) that fit inside the cup.  the frother has two lines etched inside at the bottom of the cup for fill lines that are nearly impossible to read and know they exist.  there are 3 buttons that allegedly operate the frother.  however   to date the most i’ve ever had is warm milk.  based on everything i just described i have no clue why it would ever work.  i have a hand frother that has a whisk at the end  that does the job in seconds (bought at williams sonoma) with its high speed spinning action!  thus  the main purpose i bought this unit (verses others at the same price point) is worthless!  reading other reviews  i’m not alone  it’s a function that should have been recalled for its defect or at least given everyone a refund!  now i have a huge machine wasting space on my counter  and i can’t even detach it!this machine doesn’t require 2.0  thank you!  this machine replaced my 2.0 which failed to read the pods more than it worked; we had cut off tops of those that worked to put over the failures  just to make a cup of coffee.  let’s just say 2.0 was the edsel of their line!  i have no issue with any pod nor using my own coffee.  the selections are from a shot  6  8  10  or 12 oz cup.  you can select strong which does a better job at saturating the grounds and is like a shot but just more  so it’s great for iced coffee or tea.  the negative is it doesn’t do the carafe so i have lots of pods aging away in my pantry.the cleaning isn’t the easiest.  if you have hard water  you may want to look around.  this reservoir is narrow and has a lot of ridges  edges  and curves that make it very difficult to get the hard water deposits off.  the clear plastic container  encourages the growth of algae in the reservoir and on the filter  even if you use the red or blue light.  oh yeah  you have the ability to change the uplighting in the reservoir   however it appears to be cosmetic and not ultraviolet to clarify the water.  the reservoir holds a lot for our needs and we find we have to dump the water out and refill more than we experience an empty reservoir.  so it’s a great feature.  run a blend of distilled vinegar (3:1) and water through; not straight vinegar because there’s a lot of plastic and pure distilled vinegar will ruin it.i can put my travel mugs under this as well as  my carafe from my old machine; it’s nice and tall.  i an also use an espresso cup but it will splash so i flip a regular cup upside-down and place the espresso cup on it.  my suggestion is that if you like hot coffee  then the first cup you make should just be hot water  because it isn’t that hot.  this will also warm your cup up so that your coffee isn’t hitting a cold cup and chilling it right away.  leave your cup get hot then dump it out and brew your first cup   you’ll love it way better!  if you use a milk product too and like hot coffee then make sure your cup is hot and put the milk in first so that while it is filling it with hot coffee it is organically getting it hot verses shocking it with cold in the end.  for iced coffee  you can use the shot but i use the strong button.  i fill my carafe with crushed ice and put my pod in  press strong and twelve  and then do another shot at the end with the same pod.  stir and then pour over ice!  it’s great!because of the frother not working for most people  i do not recommend this model  however it makes a good  rich cup of coffee pretty quickly; there are other models and this brand does seem to last!  they have a metal one now that looks really nice and is a counter space saver with temperature control too...so check it out!note: i use illy coffee  lavazza coffee  bentley tea  and ghirardelli-chocolate-premium-indulgence.  yeah i’m probably considered a coffee snob after 40 years of drinking the stuff i know what i like!  half and half always in the coffee!
October 22 2020,1.0,5,stay away from keurig.,after using my keurig coffee maker for seven years  my machine went bad. i was very happy with it.however  after ordering another machine through amazon  i found the machine i purchased was malfunctioning.i returned the unit and purchased a more expensive model. upon receiving it  it started to malfunction in the same way.the machine would start to brew and then power completely off in the beginning of the brew cycle.unfortunately it started this after the return date had expired.i contacted keurig and after a long drawn out process i received a replacement.much to my disappointment  the replacement is doing the same thing.i called  the company back to request a refund so i can go buy a k-cup machine from another company.basically all they will do is keep sending me inferior replacement machines. they won’t offer a refund.additionally they want me to send the defective machines back for analysis.this would be fine. i even took a video of the machine malfunctions so they could actually see what the problem is.they evidently are not interested.i have been on the phone several times trying to get them to send me return labels which for some reason they can’t seem to figure out how to do.they have no problem sending me e-mails trying to sell me their products however.in addition  every time you call  you call a different part of the globe.they always tell you they have to transfer you to the service department only to come back after putting you on hold god knows how many times  to tell you that no one will answer and they will call back within twenty for hours.the last time  that twenty for hours reached seven days before i called them back. this is the end result.so  i will be copying this review and posting it on every social media site i can find  to warn customers to stay away from this inferior company.
December 16 2021,1.0,2,frother sucks  save your $$$ * update.,light doesn’t come on. called customer service. worthless effort for the time. no point in having this machine if frother doesn’t work!! tip: if you want the frother to work… each time you use the machine  unplug it  5 seconds  plug back in. it will work for a one time use.*yes! i called customer service and can not for the life of me understand what was being said. keurig should do better.* light on the button does not come on when pressed. yes  i have waited until the machine has finished brewing  warmed up…* yes the frother is clean  and precisely measured for a latte  and it’s regular milk  and i will say a flavored creamer has worked before and frothed very well.* the machine was delivered nov 16th  today is dec 16th. so… 30 days and all of a sudden it stops working? keurig should do better than this.* i use bottled water in this machine.i am so very disappointed in keurig  for putting this limited addition on the market knowing it has suck terrible issues with its frother.shame on keurig. even though they reached out  stating to contact customer service. “ eye roll” this isn’t the experience they want me to have. * then make it right!!!
April 19 2019,5.0,9,do it! hot or cold  tea or coffee,we've never spent money on a coffee maker. this is so cool. cold or hot lattes with foamy soy milk  fresh cups with easy to clean features  no unnecessary steam stick to burn me  the parts are so easy to clean and individual. it holds a taller cup for ice coffee. i am simply amazed with it. i can use my reusable (always reusable) to make tea without the kettle. no more hassle and i really wasn't sure if i wanted to invest. we're both so happy with it. cannot be easier to operate. i hesitate to leave positive reviews because i know companies do that but i honestly love this so much. you can't find an easier coffee/tea maker that's so much fun to use.
November 29 2018,4.0,8,don't replace your old keurig.,i purchased this when my first keurig of 5 years died. the reservoir is smaller than my last one. i feel like i'm filling it alot more. the milk takes a little longer than i expected to froth. (about 3 minutes i believe)  and one thing to note is the first 2 times i used it the milk didn't froth at all. i was quite upset. but now it works fine. maybe it just had to warm up a few times. for these reasons i took off a star. i would not recommend going out to buy this if you already have a perfectly good keurig. because all you're paying for is a small reservoir and a milk warmer/frother. you can just buy a milk warmer/frother for $20-$40 and get the same results. some of the buttons on top you will find are unnecessary. over all i'm enjoying it and i purchased another one as a gift when they went half off for black friday for someone that doesnt have one.
March 9 2021,5.0,2,solid coffee maker. has been reliable since october 2019,we had two keurig’s prior to this one. the first one lasted a long time  i want to say 5 years or more. i did tinker with that one a few times opening it up and cleaning out lines etc. we then got a second used one of the same older model but it didn’t last too long.i didn’t necessarily need the frother  but this model had the highest ratings so i decided to give it a try. i’m glad i did. we get a great coffee every  morning  no issues  no variance  always the same. our go to coffee pod is the san francisco fog chaser. we have no issues with grounds in the coffee. i like the “strong” option. we both use it  it makes for a very tasty and not watery coffee. the frother actually works well  but we only use it maybe once every three months. i have descaled it once even though it didn’t really seem to need it. nothing has clogged or gotten excessively dirty yet. not sure what else to add  it does what it is supposed to do on a daily basis and if it keeps doing this for a few more years i’ll be very happy.update: still going strong in november 2021. still brews a good coffee every morning. couldn’t be happier.
November 13 2018,2.0,15,horrible frother,the coffee aspect was never an issue. the milk frother never worked. as soon as i got the machine it worked fine. the more i washed it the more the frother didn’t work. i had the item replaced once and the same thing happened again. except faster. i tried flipping the little piece inside in case it mattered the direction but it just didn’t spin anymore.
December 12 2018,3.0,9,amazing machine but has a big flaw..,i love this machine! upgraded from the keurig 2.0 and i’m impressed. only reason for not giving 5 stars is the my k cup reusable cup doesn’t fit. contacted keurig through their website for poor customer service and lack of help. have to call the help line to possibly order a new cup for the machine as the bottom needle isn’t in the right place. very disappointed. for the money it shouldn’t have a huge flaw like that.still works great with all the coffee k cups so i’m still loving it and enjoying my lattes but really disappointed i can’t enjoy making my own coffee from fresh grounds.
February 20 2019,2.0,6,why only two stars,i have owned keurig coffee makers for years. my old one starts spitting out coffee grounds into my coffee cup (along with my coffee)  so i decided it was time to replace it. i loved the option of having it make foamy warm milk  so i went with this model. all that works great (it doesn't work with heavy whipping cream though - only with milk). my reason for only two stars is because i have to turn it on every time i want a cup of coffee and then wait a few minutes for it to warm up. that kind of takes away from the convenience of walking up and starting a cup of coffee. my morning routine was to go to the coffee maker  put in a pod  and push brew (because i was able to save a default coffee size). i would start the brew process and walk off to do other things  returning to get my coffee and go to my office. now  i have to turn it on  go do other things  return to start my coffee brew (if it hasn't already turned off again)  start the brew  go do other things  and then return to get my coffee. if i wait too long between turning it on and starting the brew  i have to turn it on again and then start the whole thing over. this is such a pain. i have considered returning it because of how much i dislike this new routine. i hate having to turn it on each time i want to make a cup of coffee and waiting so long for it to heat up. also  i now  after waiting for it to heat up  have to press four buttons instead of just one (like with my old keurig). when my eyes aren't yet focused  having to press so many buttons is also a huge pain. this keurig is the opposite of convenience. perhaps  if i hadn't been spoiled by a keurig that made things so convenient  i wouldn't feel so negative about this one. it has added complexity to my mornings (and now takes longer to get coffee into my system)  so it's not helpful at all. i'd be better off just brewing a pot of coffee so i didn't have to wait so long for a cup when i needed it. i also have meetings all day and being able to quickly get another cup between meetings is essential to my focus. with this keurig  that isn't possible. i can't "quickly" get a cup of coffee at all. i hope this helps you decide which keurig to go with. i'm probably going to send this one back and get one that stays on  stays ready to brew  and doesn't require me to push so many buttons to get a cup of coffee when i can't even see straight yet.
August 9 2018,5.0,14,makes great coffee  better than regular keurig,we had the keurig revo since it was introduced.  even though it took special pods that we ordered  loved the machine.  then it was discontinued.....  ordered keurig k-cafe  this is everything we liked about the revo and so much more!  uses the regular pods and coffee is great  latte is wonderful  steamer is perfect.  didn't know keurig pods could make such good coffee  seriously good!  same coffee pods was using with regular keurig  this makes much better.  yes  we had both revo and regular keurig  both were becoming bothersome after these years and this one little machine covers it all.  k-cafe definitely a winner!
September 7 2020,1.0,2,great keurig product... for 18 months.,pros:1. gets the job done and does make a decent latte or cappucino without breaking the bank.2. appears to work best with whole milk  but still gets the job done with 2%  lactaid  and milk substitutes like almond milk.3. can make a 12 oz. cup without needing additional attachments.cons:1. wish it was possible to break down the assembly further to clean it better without needing tools. you'll get some coffee grounds that tend to gather at the bottom of the k-cup support assembly as you use it. i find the best way to get rid of them is to detach the lower part of the k-cup outlet  place back just the upper portion  and run 12 oz. of water through (hold a mug close to the drain because it is a little messy without the lower part)  then use a q-tip to get the grounds out of the nook and crannies that the water couldn't clear out.2. every once in a while i find myself having to unplug it and plug it back in to get a coffee made. seems like you'll push the buttons and nothing will happen  but resetting the whole thing seems to do the trick to get it working again.update:after 18 months  the cold button will randomly start blinking  followed by a random series of beeps like the button is randomly getting pushed. i'm not the only one with the issue. unplugging the machine for a few hours and plugging it back in will fix it for a week  then it goes right back to randomly beeping at 2:00 a.m.first and last keurig product. no k-cup will ever beat fresh ground and buying a new machine after 18 months isn't worth the convenience.
August 2 2020,2.0,2,four months and mild wear in  it’s already on the fritz,edit: it’s the end of november 2020  the same year i bought this and only a few months later  and the milk frother is not working. it seems to be cooking the milk instead and sometimes i pick up the pitcher and it’s cold underneath yet the milk is hot and sort of has this weird glossy porous bubbly froth on top. usually  you should see where the steamed milk subverts a nice airy frothy layer of milk but now it just seems to be mixing all together and coming out foamy on top. it’s not frothy at all and doesn’t taste like a latte. the picture with the glassy mug is what it looks like now and the picture with the green and white portland mug is what it should look like. pretty sure that  even as i only bought this thing just about 4 months ago and only use it 1-2 a day  it’s on the fritz. buyer beware.i waited for ages to buy a keurig until i knew that recycling the cups was possible. i’m honestly terrible about making coffee— i usually french press it or make stovetop espresso drinks  and they always came out bitter or the proportions of coffee to milk were way off. it’s so nice to just have a decent cup of coffee and this machine makes great coffee!! i love that it is “idiot proof” with the lines on the milk pitcher marked. this also takes away the need to use up more dishes by measuring it out yourself  but also ensures the correct proportions. the little parts are easy to clean— very glad the frother is magnetic because i would be scared of losing it or dropping it down the garbage disposal when washing the pitcher. bonus: the cold drink option is awesome for making iced lattes or even iced coffee  since i got it in the summer and i always bought jugs of iced coffee at the store. i absolutely love my keurig! highly recommend this machine!
January 10 2022,4.0,2,surprised,i was so excited to get my new coffee machine i owned a keurig 10 years now this is my third machine i was excited to get this because now i can start making cappuccinos and lattes as well but when i seen that one thing is missing and i found out that this certain little filter thing is not included i was shocked if you want the filter that goes in the water tank you have to go either order it online separately or go to the store i think for the price of this machine that filter thing should’ve been included just like it is included with any other keurig coffee machines that i ever owned .
July 23 2020,2.0,3,frother stopped working after three weeks. disappointed,i bought this for my husband's birthday a few weeks ago. he loved it. unfortunately  the milk frother stopped working exactly three weeks after purchasing. now it just heats up the milk instead of actually frothing it  which is a bummer since it's the sole reason i spent the extra money and bought the top of the line keurig instead of a cheaper model. the user manual offers no troubleshooting advice for this issue  and only says to call customer service. i've called keurig customer service three times to try to troubleshoot or resolve the issue (first time i waited on hold and was disconnected before the rep could get my information  second time i was told that they were busy but someone would call back that day  and after waiting all night i called back this morning and was told that it could now be up to 48 hours before i get a call back). i still have a week left in the return window  and may just be returning it back to amazon due to the defective device and the fact that keurig has seemingly terrible customer service thus far.
December 20 2018,1.0,9,pumps all the water out on the counter (don't use distilled water),note change review: finally reach someone at customer service  that knew exactly what the problem was. our older keurig  we always use distilled water in it. the newer keurigs have some kind of detector for impurities in the water so you cannot use distilled water. you must use tap water. after running a full tank of tap water through  we never had the problem again.(orginal review) purchased this newer model for my home to replace a older model. i older model i have had for many years and is now in my office at work. after the first week  multiple times we have turned this machine and it pumps all the water. no lights will turn on  it doesn't heat the water and will pump all the water out of the tank. you can unplug it and once you turn it on again... same thing. first week this was a amazing product but now a regret..... got a replacement to the first one  after a month the second keurig does the same.
January 29 2022,3.0,1,beware - possible electrical hazard,i bought this keurig just one year ago and a few weeks ago the milk spinner/frother (which has gotten minimal use) stopped working and emitted an electrical burn smell. i'm now afraid to use the machine and keurig has not responded to my email.  frustrating! if they ever respond and i get a decent result from them i will update this review  but for now  i would not recommend this brewer to anyone.**update!  keurig stands by their products and replaced my brewer.  they responded to my email by asking that i call them and once i spoke with a rep  the issue was handled and a new brewer arrived within 10 days.  here's hoping brewer #2 will last a little longer.  i still can't give this machine a higher review until i give it some time to see if it will last but i have had keurig products since the invention of k-cups and this is the first issue i have ever encountered.
November 17 2021,1.0,2,buyer beware!!!  do not waste the money!!,buyer beware!!!  sure  this coffee maker makes fancy drinks  but it only makes them long enough to get you past the point of being able to return or exchange the item.  i ordered this in november as a christmas present for my bride (and me) to enjoy.  i ordered it in november amid the "buy now while you still can" supply chain scare.  we didn't open it and start using it until a day or two after christmas when the family get togethers had slowed down.  we had family who knew i bought this for my bride  and we were gifted a box of 100 k-cups.  well  the froth maker still works like it is supposed to  but the coffee maker quit working.  after turning on the coffee maker  replacing the k-cup with a new one  then making coffee selections  the coffee maker shuts off entirely.  sure  i ordered this in november  but we have been using it barely over a month.  we haven't even used half the box of 100 k-cups  and the coffee maker has already quit working.  do not waste your money - find another similar product!  watch the video - it speaks for itself  less than 50 uses.
November 27 2020,1.0,5,failed,got one on november 14th. frother was already not working. by november 26th the whole thing stopped working. it just spews water everywhere when we try to make coffee. didn't come with an instruction manual or anything so we suspect that this one may have already been sent back for being defective and then resold as-is.
December 14 2020,5.0,3,nice machine!,so far so good. i’ve only had it a few weeks so i can’t speak to longevity but it’s very user friendly and convenient to use. i replaced an old keurig that i had for about 15 years. i love the water reservoir and the milk frother. controls are simple  easy to clean and the quality seems decent for plastic. my only complaint is that there are no fill level lines on the exterior of the frother and the inside lines are very difficult to see if the light isn’t just right for those of us whose eyes are over 40! the mechanism that you open and close that contains the pod could be stronger plastic but hopefully it will hold up. i’ll update if something goes wrong.
January 17 2021,2.0,1,frother stopped working,updated status 3/13/21.. frother stopped working. i loved this product and it was working so we'll until the frother just decided to never froth again. disappointing.if you love variety and don't want to spend $$$ for a professional brewer then this the one for.you.i bought this for the additional cappacino and latte brewing features. i am not a coffee snob by any stretch of the imagination and typically  lattes from coffee shops.coffee controls are awesome especially the automatic feature that lets you turn it on  drop in a pod  and bit brew...when ready it brews  no waiting for the water to heat up before setting up.the latte brew is great and i get two.shota of coffee from each pod though instructions say to discard after one use. i make two lattes with one pod if it's at least a medium roast coffee. light or breakfast tend to get that water down taste.the frother works perfectly and i can use any k-cup flavor to mix it up. there are separate setting for latte and cappacino and again it's pour in milk (or heavy cream) to the right line and push a button...magnetic wheel makes perfect froth you can spoon out the extra!the bad...well really the bad is if you love real cappuccino. this brewer not going to give you that barista magic hear people talk about. but if you use the cappacino pods i think it delivers a decent shot.the ehhh.... the water tank is a hot and miss. the side load with handle is awesome. my old keurig had that side tank that was awkward to move about. the capacity sucks be honest. if it could.hold two more cups of water it would be perfect in my opinion.
February 6 2022,5.0,1,finally,i was so looking forward to having a cappuccino last weekend. i just imagined myself with my pinky up being fancy. when i went to froth the milk…..nothing! i had been making regular coffee with no problem  but the frothing function did not work. amazon came to the rescue and had a new one to me in 2 days. today i made a cappuccino with a dark roast k-cup and a vanilla fair life protein shake. it frothed beautifully and was tasty. i don’t usually have a second cup  but i had to make up for last weekend. so i mixed the protein shake with some peppermint mocha creamer and used my own espresso blend coffee grounds with a scoop of hot cocoa mix. it was amazing! this machine is so easy to use and  though not as good as a coffee shop  i look forward to many coffee creations with this machine.
May 5 2021,5.0,2,coffee suddenly became more fun! make sure you use the correct milk for maximum effect.,for a long time we've had a basic keurig coffee maker  but now that we have the keurig k-cafe  coffee has become more fun!we still use the machine to make basic 'k-cup' coffee  but as a treat a few times a week or on weekends  we now make lattes or cappuccinos.tip: we have found out through trial and error that some plant-based milks work better than others. we prefer the plant based small boxes of 'creamers'  some of which are flavored. we normally brew a 8 or 10oz mug of coffee  then whip up the creamer in the cappuccino froth dispenser and pour it on top of the black coffee. i also like making hot matcha drinks using matcha powder.we really need to experiment a bit more with the machine  but we are very happy with it so far. it sure beats paying around $5 for a fancy coffee drink locally.you can also use a reusable 'basket' style k-cup and fill it with coffee grinds  if you're concerned with filling the landfills with plastic k-cups. :)it's one of those items where you think 'how did we ever do without this before'?!!
September 2 2020,4.0,3,happy with this keurig,my 2.0 finally bit the dust after about 6 years of use... just stopped pumping water.  bought this as a replacement as i thought the idea of frothing milk and the various latte/cappuccino/coffee options seemed cool.  so far so good... brews fairly quietly and really enjoying the "strong" option.  i'm really liking the frothing option  though it doesn't froth other milks (coconut  almond).  i would have given this 5 stars  but there's one gripe... it won't froth milk and brew your k-cup at the same time.  really keurig?  engineers couldn't figure out how to make that work?overall  happy with it.  i'd recommend it.
May 5 2021,3.0,1,frother stops working after a month,save your money if you're purchasing this because it has a fancy frother. for the first few weeks everything works great  good reliable brewing of your k-cups as usual and nice cappuccino or latte with your frothed milk. unfortunately the latter won't last long as the frother will just stop working after a month  just at the perfect time to make it too latefor you to return it to amazon. and then you won't have a pleasant time dealing with keurig customer service as they'll just be of no help. its been 2 weeks since i've called customer service and still have yet to hear from them again after giving them everything they asked for(proof of purchase  serial number  etc.) i will never be purchasing another product from keurig again after this unpleasant experience.update: keurig customer service reached out to me and sent me a brand new machine. their customer service is actually better than i originally thought. at least you can have that peace of mind.
October 18 2020,4.0,1,so close to five stars.,don't get me wrong  i absolutely love this espresso coffee maker  i use it  no joke  at least 2-4 times a day. very easy to use  but might take you a second if you're impatient and excited like i was when i opened it. descale just like any other keurig  it's tedious and takes a while  but no issues. i put 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a good price for what it is  a cheaper version than a real espresso machine  and honestly way ahead of competing brands in price and function. all others break down or quit whisking altogether after a few months. the only issue is the machine gets overwhelmed when you are brewing multiple espresso shots one after the other   and frothing at the same time. it can't do both half the time. it's not a malfunction or a bad machine  they're all like this. it can only really do one at a time  and sometimes it thinks too long about it. like  oh i did 2 espresso shots but you still need your cream frothed  i'll finish that first and then do another shot  and forgets it's a coffee maker and need to catch up or think harder about what it's doing.  then takes another 2 minutes to start up again  like a barista lost in conversation with a coworker and forgot they ordered two things and not just one   oh yeah i'm doing another espresso! sorry about that! so multiple espresso shots and frothing a no-go. just be patient. but if you press strong coffee and froth at the same time  halfway through the coffee it starts frothing. i've overwhelmed it doing like 6 shots before and the cappuccino frothing button glowed on and off for two minutes and never started  so i had to turn it off and back on many times before it finally did it. i love it  but if you like your espresso shots   like 4 or more  it takes time. not really complaining  it's just not a real espresso maker so it's slower and suits its purpose. if you're impatient  you might as well get the real deal for $400 or more. 4 stars to let everyone else know it's not a top of the line espresso maker and give anyone the wrong impression.
September 12 2019,2.0,4,milk frother will drive you nuts,a great cup of coffee. great latte or cappuccino  if you have the patience to reset the milk frother numerous times during the process. instructions say 'slight pressure needed on the container when starting'  no  much pressure towards the switch inside the frother slot  and even then it's a 50/50 without 6-8 retries. it's pretty obvious they did not design the switch inside the frother slot to work correctly and despite poor reviews have not bothered to fix it. took a chance  because of excellent product service with keurig k machines previously  this one breaks the mold. will not go this route again unless the objective becomes turning out quality vs volume.sadly. returned for refund. starbucks is a 5 minute ride away for us  this is a 10 min + operation in hopes to get frother to work. still like keurig products  just not this one.
November 13 2018,4.0,5,frother is amazing!,i was surprised by how good the frother on this thing is performing.  we love cappuccinos  but the starbucks prices are just exorbitant for more than a once a month 'treat'.  now  we can craft our own for a fraction of the price and tastes just as good.  i also like that i can make it exactly to taste and get creative.  everything else about the keurig is great as well; makes coffee and espresso well  easy to fill water reservoir  not overly bulky or tacky-looking on the countertop  and works well with the fill-yourself pods if you want to use your own grounds.**update:  the handle to the water reservoir has been a huge issue.  we have replaced it twice now due to the cheaply made plastic breaking at the connecting point after a few months.  we've now decided to leave the handle off completely instead of replacing it ($30 each time when bought from the keurig site).  great machine  but the handle needs a better design and stronger materials.
October 25 2020,5.0,2,i'm a trained barista and i'm still very impressed,even though its not a proper espresso/cap/latte machine it does the trick and does it very well. i like turning it on  filling the frother with milk and walking away to continue making brekkie without having to worry about the milk burning... and let me tell ya; it creates perfect microfoam every single time! i recommend filling it up a little bit higher than the recommended lines and i even take it off the frother before its finished as i find it to almost be a little too frothy for my taste. this  however; won't be a problem for the general masses. i also really enjoy the cold foam option  which is something you cannot do with most traditional espresso/cap machines on the market.my only gripe is that i really hate using the plastic pods so much because of all that plastic that is used only once and then tossed out. i've tried the dyi pods where you fill it up with the coffee of your choice  but it never ever seems to come out as good as when you use the actual pods. hopefully they'll fix this issue somehow in the future.i highly recommend this product if you enjoy a quality cup of coffee. some people just want the caffeine and couldn't care less about the taste. they might not even know what good coffee even tastes like  so if thats the case  than i would skip this version and get one of the less expensive versions that just handle the basics.
November 17 2021,4.0,4,good machine  but only lasted a year,i really enjoyed this while it lasted. bought it in august of 2020 and it started not making much coffee (even after descaling/cleaning) in october of 2021. if you buy this  do get the warranty  as i just sent the machine back for repairs and it was unfixable. but  cool thing  they gave me the full price back as an amazon gift card. so at least now i can pick something else out :) just in time for christmas!
December 17 2018,1.0,13,electrical fault  drains water  takes forever,power it up and instead of warming up to brew a cup of coffee  the water just pours out. every morning. several times. 20 minutes later it might work. today it stopped working. i’ve had this for two months. it’s done this the whole time. now the power light faintly flashes and dies. for $175  i am beyond upset. i’ve tried everything including different kinds of water. $175 and my my return window has passed. wish me luck calling keurig. the machine is beyond wonderful when it works. unfortunately it doesn’t work every day. it’s exhausting!
December 30 2021,1.0,2,worked for a bit  now a safety issue.,i purchased this in 2019. it worked well for awhile  then the frother stopped working in 2020. it was annoying  but i don't necessarily need frothy milk in my coffee and i could still make regular coffee so i just went with it.  but then this morning i got up and although the coffee maker was not on  the frothy was beeping and trying to run all by itself. i couldn't get it to stop so i unplugged it and the plug was hot to the touch. due to the disturbing catastrophic failure of this machine and the fact that i consider it a fire hazard  i would never buy or recommend a keurig again.
April 25 2019,5.0,4,a definite upgrade from mr. coffee cafe barista,the photos are after about a month in a half of using at least 4 times a day. it did not arrive like that.  my family bought this when we remodeled our kitchen to replace our old mr. coffee cafe barista. my entire family was telling me this is a waste of money  it won't be as good  it will make "fake coffee"(for some reason my father thought that k-cups were just a concentrated liquid that dispersed through water)  etc. i finally said lets just buy it and if it doesn't work out i'll get another mr. coffee with my own money. now it is my family's favorite coffee machine we have ever used. you can even buy reusable filters(we bought 2 of them) so that you don't need to use k-cups.  with our old mr. coffee  the pieces were very small and difficult to clean. it came with two filters. a double shot filter and a single shot. mr. coffee didn't sell either of these individually so if you broke either of them you could either buy a cheap knock-off single shot off of their website or spend $200 on a new machine just for the filter. they did not even sell a cheap knock-off double shot. only a cheap knock-off single shot. this was very bad because my family only ever used the double shot. whenever my father was done making coffee  he would actually hit the filter against the trash can so hard(to empty the grounds) that he would actually pop a small piece of the filter out and someone else would find it in the trash. disgusting. eventually he did that and no one was able to find the piece of the filter that got lost in the trash. that is the other reason we bought this machine  because no one in my house uses single shot(18  22  56  and 59 years old).thankfully  with this one that is literally impossible.  the other thing i didn't like is that the rest of the machine had super small parts which made it super difficult to clean. cleaning to milk frother took at least a half hour because we would literally have to grab a screwdriver and take the entire frother apart to clean all of the bits. with this thing it is literally just a ring. the other thing about the frother that i didn't like is that you would put in a bunch of milk(it doesn't tell you how much is good for just one cup) and just put what wasn't used in the fridge. then  because the frother isn't air tight the milk would rot and you had to dump out the milk and clean the milk container(thankfully not the whole frother). with this you just put in milk for 1 cup which is perfect. no more rotten milk. besides the milk container on this takes less than a minute to clean at most. also  on this machine you can chose to froth the milk cold  which is fantastic for cooling your boiling hot coffee to drinkable temperatures. mr. coffee didn't have anything like that.  lastly  the travel mug "option" on this thing is so much better. on the mr. coffee  you took out a plate and you basically just put the mug in a hole and hoped that was large enough for the base of your mug. in our case  we had to brew multiple cups of coffee and pour them into the mug(which was a very long process). on this machine  you literally just slide out the drip tray and put the mug right there. more than large enough for any reasonably sized travel mug.  my family also really liked the "strong" brew option on this thing. with mr. coffee the closest you could get to that is putting in the double shot filter but then pressing the "single shot" brew option. again  this was a definite upgrade.
November 6 2019,2.0,3,inconvenient with all plastic "nickel",this keurig works fine  but if i had to do it again i would get a more basic  higher water capacity model for 60% less money.  i was curious if the frother would be worth it  and its not.  the foamy milk isn't tasty and you have to wash the frother after each use which makes it generally less convenient for nothing special  so we wind up not using it.  i prefer squirting whipped cream in to the coffee.also  for whatever reason several more buttons have to be pressed each time  it doesnt remember your last cup and there are no defaults that you can set  like my now dead previous model.the worst thing is i paid $50 extra for "nickel" and its 100% cheap looking plastic.all consider  buy a well priced model and forget the inconvenient  no taste frother.
October 5 2018,2.0,11,arrived with broken handle,i ordered the keurig k-cafe along two two large boxes of k-cups  but upon opening the amazon shipping carton i found the keurig k-cafe box was packed upside down in the shipping carton. when i took the keurig k-cafe box out of the amazon carton i noticed it was damaged on one side and then when i opened it i found the handle on the water reservoir was broken with the pieces laying in the bottom. as the amazon shipping carton had no outer damage whatsoever i can only assume that the keurig k-cafe box was dropped or damaged before being packed and shipped to me by amazon. otherwise the k-cafe is a great little coffee maker and the milk frothing jug is wonderful - minus a handle!
February 18 2020,1.0,2,missing a lot of keurig features,i thought this would be an upgrad to my last few keurigs. no so much. for the first time  there is no light inside the water tank  or anyplace to attach my keurig water filter (of which i have quite a few). also the tank is always full of condensation making it hard to see the water leval. this is also the first one i've had without a clock  so it's never heated and waiting for me in the morning. unlike any other of my keurigs  this does not have a cup size setting that the machine "remembers". so every cup the size had to be chosen. as a matter of fact  you have to push 3 buttons for each cup of coffee  where all the others were close the lid  push the brew button. i'm really not sure if i wish to keep this machine. now that i kept it  it's giving me problems. i called keurig cust. service  they are no help at all. almost 200 dollats for this machine and they will not honor warranty... so far.
September 15 2020,2.0,2,used for 8 months and just realized what a crappy cup of coffee it makes,i have been using this unit for almost 9 months - i had never used a regular keurig before until away on vacation this past weekend and now i know how deficient this unit is.  while i was away i used the exact same coffee with a single regular model keurig that was available and was shocked at the rich and flavorful cup of brew that was produced. i have struggled with this unit to make a decent cup and i am not a super dark coffee fan. the cup is weak even at the 8oz size on strong almost watery. the best part of this unit is by far the milk frother it works beautifully  so if you want a glorified milk frother with an ability to make a weak cup of coffee this one is for you
December 24 2020,5.0,1,works like a charm!,love it! i needed to get a coffee maker that made everything because since covid i’ve been getting a lot more starbucks and it was beginning to get expensive. in an effort to save money  i looked for a new machine that could make things like lattes and cappuccinos. stumbled across this and as soon as i saw that it had an automatic warmer and frother  that was all i needed to hear!i’m absolutely in love with it! if you’re a huge latter drinker  this is the machine for you! you make your coffee like you regularly would  put the cup in and select the size and if you want it strong. then you get the cup  which has indicated lines on the inside for how much milk to put  & add your milk. to give it that extra ✨starbucks✨ feel  i use my regular oat milk and add my creamer so that i don’t have to add sugar or anything else to it.the machine once you hit the latte setting and it’s done brewing the coffee will both heat up and froth your milk for you! it’s amazing! i love that i can literally put a kcup in the machine  put milk in a cup  press a button & just walk away and this machine will do everything.get it! if you’re on the fence  just do it! it’s so worth it! i save so much money making my coffees at home now! i even picked up some of those disposable coffee cups with cute designs on them from homegoods and if i need a coffee on the go i just use one of those! or my reusable cup from starbucks.
December 2 2018,3.0,4,great idea! poor execution,this is maybe my 4th or 5th keurig coffeemaker. i am used to them working for a year or two  then failing. typically they first start by needing descaling (which occasionally works) about 6 months into use. then by the years into using them  their pump looses strength and you have to pocke the pod before you put it in the machine. fortunately  keurig has really good customer service and they do exchange your failing coffee maker which happened with our last one 6 months ago. but when that failed  and intrigued by the latte making capabilities  we ordered this one. loved it at first. but two weeks into the use (almost to the day) it’s started shutting off when you push the brew button   two hours of two attempts of descaling  with the solution purchased from amazon  which involves running running 8 reservoirs of water through it it’s still being glitchy. right now works for every other cup. when you push the brew button   the whole machine shuts off .
September 7 2018,5.0,4,worth it.,i had the orginal keurig for about 3 or 4 years and then last year it broke. i couldn't bring myself to spend so much money on another coffee machine that didn't last that long and towards the end stopped working as well. after going back and forth i decided to purchase this k cafe edition and i am so glad i did.things that i love:-the vareity of coffee options  it can make different sized coffee's and even has a 'strong' setting.-the fact there is a light that comes on when it is time to descale. i definitely think this feature will pro long the life of the coffee machine.-huge water reservoir  don't need to fill every time.-no need to change a water filter like in the older models.if i had to say one bad thing it would be that if you want more than one espresso shot you have to use more than 1 kcup  which if you want like 5 shots of espresso every day might be pricey.overall  i am so happy i made this purchase. definitely worth the money  buy it.i will keep this review updated if anything changes.
June 8 2021,3.0,0,k cups - great; universal reusable coffee filter - don't even think about it,we bought this unit for several reasons: ability to brew both coffee and shots for latte's and the versatility of brewing both k cups and bring your own coffee using the universal reusable coffee filter ("urcf").  this unit gets most of it right except for the part about using your own coffee grounds.  we've read all the directions and done everything in accordance with keurig guidance  but can do nothing about coffee grounds spilling out of the urcf.  i've since read about others who experienced the same issue  but in a nutshell  the pods and the urcf are about the size as a shot glass but the only paper filters you can get for it are the size of those little cups you fill up with ketchup at the burger joint which is about half the size of the urcf.  the filters specifically say not to push them down to the bottom of the urcf so i assumed there was some strategic reason keurig needed the extra space that was below the paper filter but still inside the urcf.  well  we experimented with varying amounts of medium ground coffee (they do warn you that fine ground will clog it up) and the best it could handle without incident was about 1/2 tablespoon  or enough coffee to brew about 4 oz.  but the minimum size of the machine is a 6 oz cup.  my wife likes 12 to kick-start her day so that was a non-starter.  there is the possibility of using the urcf without a paper filter but that's not something we wanted to entertain due to the mess.  but hey  the pods work great.
February 23 2021,5.0,2,in love with this machine!,received this as a gift from my husband (this is his account). oh mannn! this is a game changer for me. i love lattes but hate spending the money and the calories for purchased ones. fyi  good for lattes and cappuccinos but not espressos. unless someone has a hack that i don’t know about. i use the reusable plastic k cups for the coffee. i have been able to froth not just half and half but also almond milk and today.. cinnamon flavored oat milk. fantastic! i use stevia in the coffee. so low cal and delicious! just a tip though. the instructions say to froth milk first and then make coffee. umm no. the milk separates pretty fast. make the coffee  then froth the milk. while the milk is frothing  add your sweetener of choice to the coffee and pour the milk in immediately. it is a wonderful price for something that brings this coffee hound so much joy. good job keurig!
December 14 2021,5.0,0,awesome !!,i bought a top-end keurig elite two years ago and it still works great.  i bought this for the frothing and a hedge against the elite deteriorating somehow.  elite temperature was adjustable and mine was set to 192.  i always used the “strong” option.this new one makes hotter and much stronger coffee!  i love strong dark roast  black.  i have used death wish  starbucks  etc.  for a while now  i’ve settled on peet’s major.  i never have more than two cups on the strong setting.  this new coffee maker is bordering on too much on the strong setting at two cups.  one cup is sufficient.the frothing is exceptional!  it is legit.  buy some torani syrups for the coffee and frothing.  mix and match.  one flavor in the coffee and another in the froth.i have never bought a better coffee anywhere.  not at any price.i don’t know how long it will last.  will update.
April 23 2019,1.0,5,horrible.,this is my third keurig.  i thought i would send it back  but i let the date slip up on me.  despite repeated washing  coffee still tastes off.  it definitely gets too hot.  it is at least 5 minutes before i can drink it.  maybe the extra heat makes it too bitter.  i don't see much froth  so it doesn't work for the fancy coffees that i bought it for.  you have to push 5 buttons to get a simple cup of coffee--on  coffee  size cup  k   -- a guess that is just 4 but in comparison with my previous keurig  it takes forever to set it up.  why do you have to press k to make it work?  it is nice having the choices of size  but it is not totally consistent.  sometimes the 12 oz size gives a 6 or 8 oz cup of coffee. it may be my imagination  but i think that it holds less water than my previous one (that cost half as much).  i don't know whether i got  the "lemon"  or if there are design flaws.
November 15 2021,1.0,1,currently annoyed,i'm currently extremely annoyed with this machine. we've had it for about 3 weeks and yesterday  the frother stopped working and today (the next day)  it has stopped brewing. it tries and then shuts off  leaving me with a big mess to clean each time. i'm reaching out to keurig first to see if they can fix it or offer a solution  but the fact that i've owned this thing for 3 weeks and its taking a dump isn't a good sign  especially for how much it costs. i'll update my review if it gets fixed and lasts longer than 3 weeks.**update**keurig never got back to me - i contacted them directly on their website so i decided to just return the product and get a refund. unfortunately  it seems like we'll have to buy another keurig product (probably a standard one this time) as they're the industry standard for this type of coffee  we're just hoping the next one doesn't suck like this one did.
February 29 2020,4.0,1,fun and affordable,i just used my unit for the first time last night. it is very easy and fun to use. but  unless you've had a home latte/cappuccino machine before  i recommend watching a youtube vid before the first use. this provides a step by step visual instruction of the proper way to do things.  i do wish that the housing was metal rather than plastic for a more "upscale" appearance but it is attractive enough. it does not come with the my k cup universal reusable filter pod (for use with your own ground coffee) so that must be purchased separately. this is not a cheap unit so i feel this should be included. the my k cup works great but there is a bit of a learning curve to get the cap to align properly with the base of the pod. i must have done it right because the shot came out ok. if you are making a latte or cappuccino  i recommend using a high grade espresso bean freshly ground with a burr grinder. i am not a coffee snob and don't even drink it every day but when i do  i want it to taste like it came from a good coffee shop. the frother is a real time saver as it does all the work for you. i used skim milk and had loads of foam for a gorgeous topper.  as for longevity  we will see but i am hopeful. cheers!
